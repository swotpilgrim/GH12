# VENGEANCE #12: RIVER REVENGE - BIBLE

## Story Premise

Mississippi River, 1978. Jordan Hayes, 22, is a barge worker's daughter who grew up on the water—her father Cal taught her navigation, mechanics, and every mile of river from Memphis to the Gulf. When Cal discovers Riverside Freight is smuggling drugs in cargo barges and threatens to report it, company boss Wade Turner has him drowned with chain weights and dumped in the river. Ruled accidental drowning. Jordan finds her father's hidden notes about the smuggling operation and takes his personal tugboat—a 32-foot diesel workhorse named *Proud Mary*. She loads it with weapons and hunts Turner's smugglers through the river system, killing them port by port, dock by dock, using the river itself as her weapon. Every smuggler who works the Mississippi learns the same lesson: the river has teeth, and her name is Hayes. Body count 26. Ends with massive explosion at New Orleans docks and Jordan disappearing into the Gulf, a river legend.

## Protagonist Profile

**Jordan Hayes, 22.** Five-foot-seven, lean and rope-muscled from years of physical labor. Dark blonde hair kept short (practical for boat work), sun-weathered skin, calloused hands. Wears work clothes exclusively: jeans, canvas work shirts, steel-toed boots, oil-stained canvas jacket. No makeup, no jewelry except her father's river watch on a chain around her neck.

**Background:** Born and raised on the Mississippi. Mother died when Jordan was six (cancer). Cal Hayes raised her alone while working barges for Riverside Freight—she grew up essentially homeless, living on whatever boat Cal was assigned to. Never finished high school (dropped out at 16 to work river jobs full-time). Has worked as deckhand, mechanic's assistant, dock loader, fuel dock attendant. Knows every major port from Memphis to New Orleans, every barge captain, every diesel mechanic, every dock rat and river runner.

**Skills acquired through river life:** Expert boat pilot (can handle anything from johnboats to towboats), diesel engine mechanic (learned by necessity—break down on river, you fix it yourself), navigation (knows channels, currents, hiding spots, emergency landings), swimming (could swim before she could read), basic firearms (Cal taught her to shoot for river rats and water moccasins). Comfortable with violence—river culture is rough, she's been in bar fights, dealt with handsy drunks, survived in a male-dominated world through toughness.

**Personality:** Quiet, watchful, doesn't waste words. Speaks in river slang and working-class directness. Deeply loyal to river community (the decent ones). Has her father's stubbornness—once committed, doesn't quit. Not heroic or noble—this is pure revenge, making them pay the way they made Cal pay. Comfortable being alone (spent childhood on boats with just her father). Drinks whiskey, smokes Camels, sleeps in boat cabins, eats at dock diners.

**Combat capability:** Proficient with shotgun and rifle (hunting weapons, not military). Good instinctive shooter but no formal training. Relies on river knowledge and ambush tactics—she knows the terrain, they don't. Willing to fight dirty: use boat as weapon, drown people, shoot from hiding, ram vessels. Not trained fighter—survives through ruthlessness and home advantage. Limitations: no hand-to-hand training, limited ammunition (has to scavenge/buy), injured she's vulnerable (no backup, no medical support).

**Current situation:** Father dead two weeks when story opens. Jordan has taken *Proud Mary* (Cal's personal tug, technically hers now), loaded it with Cal's hunting rifles and shotgun, and begun hunting. Has already killed the two dock workers who physically drowned Cal. Now reading his notes about the larger operation, planning systematic revenge.

## Villain Profile

**Wade Turner, 51.** Barrel-chested, six-foot-two, 240 pounds of dock muscle going to fat. Graying red hair, permanent sunburn, missing part of left ear (barge cable accident). Always wears: steel-toed work boots, canvas work pants, sweat-stained white t-shirt, and a Riverside Freight cap with captain's insignia. Chomps unlit cigars (doesn't smoke them, just chews). Hands scarred from decades of river work. Voice like gravel, river-rat accent.

**Background:** Started as deckhand in 1940s, worked his way to captain, bought into Riverside Freight in 1965, now owns controlling interest. Legitimate business moves 40% of commercial barge traffic between Memphis and New Orleans—chemicals, grain, coal, manufactured goods. Discovered in 1974 that hollow barge compartments could move tons of marijuana and cocaine. Now runs both operations: legit freight (cover) and massive drug smuggling (real money). Has dozen barge captains working for him, half legitimate, half smugglers.

**Operation:** Riverside Freight operates 30 barges, 8 towboats. Smuggling works through modified barges with false compartments welded into hulls. Drugs loaded at Memphis (from trucks coming down from Chicago), moved downriver hidden in legitimate cargo, offloaded at New Orleans to distribution network. Revenue: $200K monthly from smuggling (1978 dollars). Network includes dirty port inspectors, Coast Guard contact, dock bosses at major ports.

**Evil M.O.:** Turner's signature is "river burial"—anyone who crosses him gets chain-weighted and drowned. He personally supervises. Forces victim to watch as chains are wrapped, then pushes them off dock or barge deck himself. Quotes Bible verses while doing it (Jonah thrown to the deep, Pharaoh's army drowned, etc.). Has killed at least nine people this way over four years. Bodies occasionally surface downriver, always ruled accidental drowning (chains break loose from "industrial accidents").

**Personality:** Plays good-old-boy river boss in public—backslapping, tells stories, knows everyone's name. In private: stone-cold killer with religious justification (sees himself as Old Testament figure dispensing justice to sinners and traitors). Calls everyone "son" or "girl" regardless of age. Catchphrase: "River takes what river wants." Believes he owns the Mississippi—his river, his rules, his kingdom. Enormous ego: can't imagine anyone challenging him successfully.

**Weaknesses:** Overconfident (ruled river 30 years, thinks he's untouchable). Predictable routine (inspects New Orleans docks every Friday). Underestimates Jordan (dismisses her as grief-crazy girl, doesn't see threat until too late). Relies on size and intimidation (not tactical thinker). Keeps physical records of smuggling in dockside office (insurance against partners double-crossing).

**Relationship to protagonist:** Turner personally drowned Cal Hayes—made his two regular enforcers (Keller and Boone) do the chain-wrapping, but Turner pushed Cal off the dock himself while quoting Jonah 1:15. Jordan doesn't know this initially (learns it mid-story), which deepens her fury. Turner killed the only family she had and the only life she knew.

## Supporting Characters

**Cal Hayes (deceased, appears in flashbacks).** 48 when killed. Jordan's father, 25-year Riverside Freight veteran. Gruff but loving, taught Jordan everything about river. Discovered smuggling by accident (saw drugs being loaded at Memphis dock), confronted Turner thinking he didn't know (Turner ran it), signed his death warrant. Appears in Jordan's memory throughout—his voice in her head, mechanical lessons, navigation advice. His death is the engine of the story.

**Lyle Keller, 34.** Turner's primary enforcer. Six-foot-four, 260 pounds, dock brawler. Helped chain and drown Cal Hayes. Jordan kills him in Chapter 2 (ambush at Memphis fuel dock, shotgun blast, dumps body in river with chains—poetic justice). His death triggers Turner's realization someone's hunting his crew. Brutal but stupid, follows orders without question.

**Ray Boone, 29.** Turner's other enforcer. Wiry, mean, carries a knife, ex-con. Helped drown Cal Hayes. Jordan kills him Chapter 3 (lures him onto isolated barge, shoots him, river burial). More dangerous than Keller (smarter, faster) but dies early. His death confirms pattern—someone knows who killed Cal.

**Marcus Webb, 41.** Black deckhand on legitimate Riverside Freight barge, doesn't know about smuggling. Knew Cal Hayes, respected him. Jordan contacts him Chapter 6 for information about Turner's operation. Webb is reluctant (has family, can't risk Turner) but gives Jordan intel about dock schedules and which captains are dirty. Survives—Jordan keeps him clear of action. Represents decent working people caught in criminal system.

**Diane Trosclair, 38.** Owner of riverside bar in Baton Rouge (The River Rat). Knows everyone on the river, hears everything, stays neutral. Lets Jordan hide at her dock (Chapter 18) when Turner's hunters are close. Former river worker herself, widow. Tough, seen everything, doesn't judge. Provides Jordan with ammunition and supplies (paid transactions, not charity). Motherly but not soft. Warns Jordan she's heading for death but doesn't try to stop her. Survives.

**Captain Frank Guidry, 56.** Turner's head smuggling captain, runs the New Orleans operation. Cajun, experienced river man, completely amoral. Coordinates drug offloading and distribution. Jordan kills him Chapter 20 (shoots him on his own tugboat, sinks boat with body aboard). Villain's most competent lieutenant—if he'd been hunting Jordan from the start, she might not have survived. Death leaves Turner vulnerable at New Orleans.

## Setting Details

**Mississippi River System, 1978.** Focus on working river—commercial docks, barge traffic, fuel stations, riverside bars, tugboat anchorages. Not tourist riverboats or plantation houses—this is industrial waterway moving America's cargo. Atmosphere: diesel fuel smell, rust, muddy water, heat and humidity, mosquitoes, the constant low rumble of towboat engines pushing barge strings.

**Memphis Docks (Chapters 1-8):** Industrial port, grain elevators, chemical storage tanks. President's Island area—working docks, truck traffic, rail yards. Riverside Freight headquarters: cinderblock office building, maintenance yard, diesel tanks, three dock berths. Atmosphere: early morning fog off river, coffee from dock diners, men in hard hats and work boots, the smell of grain dust and diesel. Working-class geography: dock bars (names like River Rat, Barge Inn), cheap motels for transient workers, truck stops on riverside highways. Jordan knows every fuel dock, every mechanic, every place to hide a 32-foot tug.

**River Between Memphis and New Orleans (Chapters 9-23):** Thousand miles of brown water. Towboats pushing 15-barge tows (coal, grain, chemicals). Navigation markers (red and green buoys), sandbars, currents, channel depth constantly changing. Small riverside towns: Vicksburg, Natchez, Baton Rouge—each with commercial docks, fuel stops, barge fleeting areas (where barges are parked waiting for pickup). Isolated areas: wooded banks, abandoned landings, side channels where Jordan can hide *Proud Mary* for days. Night operations: running dark (no lights), navigation by starlight and river knowledge, ambushing smuggler boats at isolated moorings.

**New Orleans Docks (Chapters 24-30):** Industrial Canal area, Chalmette docks. Massive port operation—oceangoing ships, warehouses, cranes, constant activity. Riverside Freight's New Orleans facility: six dock berths, warehouse complex, offices. This is where drugs are offloaded to trucks for distribution. Atmosphere: oil refineries across river, smell of coffee roasting (Folgers plant), creosote from dock pilings, salt air from Gulf. Tactical considerations: more witnesses, more security, harder to ambush—but also more chaos Jordan can disappear into. Final battle: nighttime, Turner's main barge docked at berth, fuel tanks nearby (explosion danger/opportunity).

**Jordan's Base—*Proud Mary*:** 32-foot steel-hulled diesel tugboat, built 1952, battered but functional. Single cabin with bunk, tiny galley, head (bathroom), wheelhouse with controls. Twin diesel engines (Detroit Diesel 6-71s), pushes barges or tows boats, top speed 8 knots. Jordan lives aboard—sleeping bag on bunk, camp stove, Coleman lantern. Weapons stored in hidden compartments Cal built. Radio for monitoring river traffic. Can moor anywhere, blend in with working boats, uses diesel fuel docks across river system. This boat is her home, weapon, and escape route.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

**Prose Style:** Hard-boiled pulp, working-class authentic. Short declarative sentences. No literary flourishes—this is functional prose for functional people. Favor concrete details over abstractions: not "she felt angry" but "her hands tightened on the wheel." Use technical river language: towboats not tugboats (towboats push barges, tugboats pull ships), barge strings not barge trains, fleeting areas not parking lots. Profanity as authentic working-class people use it—frequent but not gratuitous.

**Jordan's Internal Voice:** Minimal introspection. She thinks in practical terms: navigation, tactics, fuel levels, ammunition count. When emotional content surfaces, it's brief and physical: tightness in chest, hands shaking, Cal's voice in her memory. No philosophical musings about morality of revenge—she's past that. River metaphors: thinking of Turner's operation as a tow she's breaking apart barge by barge, herself as current that wears away obstacles.

**Dialogue Style:** River slang and working-class directness. "Ain't" and double negatives common. Profanity: "goddamn," "son of a bitch," "bastard." Regional: Memphis vs. Cajun (Baton Rouge/New Orleans) speech patterns. Turner talks like Old Testament preacher mixed with dock boss. Jordan speaks little—questions are direct, answers are minimal. Example: "Where's Turner keep the records?" "Dock office." "Locked?" "Yeah." "Who has keys?" Men underestimate her based on age and gender—she uses this.

**Violence Description:** Graphic but efficient. Body count matters—track it. Deaths functional: shotgun blast, dumped in river, move on. Not lingering torture or sadism. River deaths have specific details: weight of chains, coldness of water, current pulling bodies downriver. Weapon effects realistic: rifles for distance, shotguns for close work, pistols unreliable on moving boats.

**Pacing:** Fast. Every chapter drives forward—planning, action, consequences, next target. No extended description breaks. Atmosphere emerges through action details: Jordan smelling diesel fuel while reloading shotgun, tasting river water spray during boat chase. Reference tone: 1976 Executioner novel transplanted to Mississippi River, female protagonist doesn't change the hard pulp engine.

## Weapons & Tactics

**Primary Weapons:** Remington 870 pump shotgun (12-gauge, 18-inch barrel, holds 6 shells). Cal's deer rifle (Remington Model 700 in .30-06, scope, bolt-action). Colt Python .357 revolver (6-shot, kept in wheelhouse for close defense). All inherited from Cal—hunting weapons, not military hardware.

**Ammunition:** Jordan carries limited supply, must scavenge from kills or buy at sporting goods stores (pays cash, multiple locations to avoid pattern). 12-gauge: 00 buckshot for close work, slugs for distance. .30-06: standard hunting rounds. .357: hollow-points. Realistic constraint: running low on ammunition forces tactical choices.

**Backup Weapons:** Hunting knife (fixed blade, 8-inch), boat hook (improvised weapon/tool), fire axe (shipboard safety equipment doubles as weapon). Acquired from kills: pistols, shotguns (various conditions). Uses whatever works—not precious about weapons.

**Boat as Weapon:** *Proud Mary*'s steel hull and diesel engines make it battering ram. Jordan uses it to ram smaller boats, pin vessels against docks, create collisions. Can push barges into obstacles. Boat warfare: close-quarters maneuvering in confined channels, using current and river knowledge for advantage.

**Tactical Approach:** Ambush predator, not frontal assault. Jordan uses river knowledge—hides in side channels, approaches at night, kills from cover, disappears before response. Picks off isolated targets: lone guard at fuel dock, captain on his personal boat, smuggler making delivery. Avoids fair fights (would lose). Ruthless: shoots people in back, drowns wounded, uses any advantage. Not sporting—this is extermination.

**Combat Style:** Efficient and brutal. Shotgun at close range (doesn't require precision). Rifle from hiding (scoped shots at unaware targets). Revolver as last resort (boat motion makes pistols unreliable). She fights dirty: uses boat's spotlight to blind targets before shooting, runs over swimmers, ambushes from below docks. Survival through superior preparation and terrain knowledge.

**Limitations:** Solo operator (no backup, every wound potentially fatal). Limited ammunition (must conserve, plan kills carefully). No formal training (good shooter from practice, not military tactics). Vulnerable when off water (loses home advantage). Captured means death (no rescue coming).

## Themes

**Primary Theme:** Working-class justice vs. institutional corruption. Cal reported smuggling through proper channels—Turner owned those channels. Law won't touch Turner (owns cops, judges, inspectors), so Jordan delivers river justice. Theme manifests in action: every smuggler she kills represents Turner's immunity, every dock battle shows regular people betrayed by systems meant to protect them.

**Revenge as Vocation:** Jordan isn't conflicted about revenge—it's the job she's doing, methodically, competently. Like her father taught her to navigate or fix engines, she applies same working-class approach to hunting smugglers. Not psychological journey—it's work. She tracks kills like maintenance log: task completed, next task.

**River as Character:** The Mississippi is neutral arbiter—doesn't care about law or crime, just takes what sinks. Jordan uses river's indifference: bodies dumped get carried away, evidence disappears into current, river hides her and swallows her enemies. Theme: humans impose their laws, but river has its own rules, older and more permanent.

**Protagonist's Relationship:** Jordan doesn't "learn" anything—she completes her task. No moral growth or redemption. She starts wanting Turner dead, ends with Turner dead, considers job done. Resolution: she's traded her life for her father's revenge. Whether that's worth it isn't questioned—it simply is. She vanishes into Gulf having accomplished what she set out to do, becomes river legend like her father wanted to be.
