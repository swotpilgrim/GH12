# VENGEANCE #12: RIVER REVENGE - MASTER OUTLINE

## ACT ONE: SETUP (Chapters 1-8)

### Chapter 1: "River Funeral"

Jordan Hayes stands at her father's graveside in Memphis, listening to the preacher lie about accidental drowning. She's 22, river-raised, and knows Cal Hayes didn't slip off a dock drunk. Setting: cheap cemetery near President's Island docks, morning fog, diesel smell from nearby barges. Wade Turner attends—plays grieving boss, offers Jordan condolences and Cal's final paycheck. She takes the money, watches him, says nothing. After funeral, she returns to Cal's rented room above river bar, finds his hidden notebook documenting Riverside Freight smuggling operation: dates, barge numbers, names. Evidence he died for. Chapter ends: Jordan takes notebook, keys to *Proud Mary*, and Cal's hunting rifles. Decision made. Body count: 0.

### Chapter 2: "The Drowning"

Flashback chapter showing Cal's death two weeks prior. Cal works night shift, sees drugs being loaded into modified barge compartment. Confronts Turner next day—thinks boss doesn't know about smuggling, offers to keep quiet if it stops. Turner smiles, quotes Bible verse about deep waters. That night: Keller and Boone grab Cal at dock, wrap him in chains while Turner watches. Cal fights, realizes Jordan will be alone, begs for his life. Turner pushes him off dock personally, watches him sink. "River takes what river wants." Body floats up three days later downriver, ruled accidental. Returns to present: Jordan on *Proud Mary*, reading Cal's notes, understanding what happened. Loads shotgun. Body count: 0 (Cal's death is prologue to revenge).

### Chapter 3: "Fuel Dock"

Jordan stakes out Memphis fuel dock where Keller works part-time. She knows his schedule from Cal's notes—he fuels barges every Tuesday/Thursday evening. Setting: industrial fuel dock, diesel pumps, empty at dusk. Keller arrives in company truck, alone. Jordan approaches on foot (left *Proud Mary* moored upstream), shotgun hidden under canvas jacket. Keller recognizes her, says something crude about Cal. She shoots him twice—chest and head. Drags body to dock edge, wraps it in mooring chains (irony intentional), dumps it in river. Takes his wallet, keys, pistol. No witnesses. Chapter ends: Jordan back on *Proud Mary*, hands shaking, first kill done. Body count chapter: 1. Running total: 1.

### Chapter 4: "Isolation"

Jordan hunts Ray Boone. Cal's notes say Boone works barge fleeting area upriver from Memphis—isolated area where empty barges are parked. She motors *Proud Mary* upstream at dawn, finds Boone alone on tethered barge doing maintenance. Approaches pretending to be lost tourist, asks directions. Boone leers, comes close. She pulls Colt Python, shoots him in stomach. He goes down. Jordan boards barge, stands over him. "You remember Cal Hayes?" Boone realizes who she is, tries to plead. She shoots him in head. Wraps body in chains (same method), dumps it between barges where current will take it under. Searches his pockets—finds nothing useful. Returns to *Proud Mary*, heads back to Memphis. Two down. Body count chapter: 1. Running total: 2.

### Chapter 5: "The Coordinator"

Jordan identifies next target from Cal's notes: Travis Polk, smuggling coordinator who schedules drug shipments at Memphis port. Polk works dock office, legitimate job as freight scheduler. Jordan follows him for two days, learns routine. He drinks at riverside bar (The Anchor) every night. Third night: Jordan waits in parking lot. Polk leaves drunk, alone. She confronts him behind his truck, rifle aimed at his chest. Forces him to talk—confirms Turner runs operation, names other smugglers, reveals Keller and Boone drowned Cal on Turner's orders. Jordan shoots him, loads body in his own truck, drives to isolated dock, dumps body and truck in river (weighted with engine block). Returns on foot to *Proud Mary*. Body count chapter: 1. Running total: 3.

### Chapter 6: "Recognition"

Turner realizes pattern—three of his people dead in one week, all connected to smuggling operation, all river burials. Calls meeting with remaining crew, warns someone's hunting them. Suspects rival operation or cartel. Doesn't consider Cal's daughter (dismisses her as grieving girl). Meanwhile: Jordan contacts Marcus Webb, legitimate deckhand who knew Cal. Webb reluctant but owes Cal's memory—tells Jordan which barge captains are dirty, when next smuggling shipment runs (Friday night, heading downriver). Jordan plans to hit the barge itself. Webb warns her she's going to get killed. She doesn't care. Chapter ends: Jordan loading *Proud Mary* with weapons, fuel, supplies for extended river travel. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 3.

### Chapter 7: "Barge Takedown"

Friday night. Turner's smuggling barge (disguised as grain shipment) departs Memphis heading south. Jordan follows in *Proud Mary*, running dark (no lights). Waits until barge reaches isolated stretch below Memphis, crew bedded down. She rams *Proud Mary* into crew quarters at speed, boards during chaos. Five crew aboard: captain, engineer, three deckhands (all armed). Firefight on barge deck: Jordan uses shotgun, drops two immediately. Third pulls pistol, she shoots him with rifle. Captain and engineer try to reach weapons—she kills both. Entire fight under three minutes. Searches barge, finds drug compartment (tons of cocaine), opens valves to flood barge. It sinks slowly as she motors away. Chapter ends: five bodies going down with barge and drug cargo. Body count chapter: 5. Running total: 8.

### Chapter 8: "Point of No Return"

Turner learns his smuggling barge sank—crew missing, cargo lost (half million dollars). Realizes this isn't rival operation, it's personal. His people start asking questions, some want out. Turner locks down operation, puts bounty on information. Meanwhile: Jordan restocks ammunition at sporting goods store in Tennessee (paid cash), buys supplies, refuels *Proud Mary*. She's committed now—can't stop until Turner's dead or she is. Radio chatter indicates Turner sending hunters south to patrol river, looking for her. She heads downriver anyway, into Mississippi. Chapter ends: Jordan passing into Mississippi state line at night, knowing Turner's entire organization will be hunting her now. Point of no return. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 8.

## ACT TWO: ESCALATION (Chapters 9-23)

### Chapter 9: "Tennessee Line"

Jordan moors *Proud Mary* in hidden cove just south of Tennessee-Mississippi border. Listens to river radio traffic—Turner's people searching for whoever sank the barge. They don't know it's her yet. She scouts nearby town (small river port), identifies Riverside Freight fuel station. Two workers there—both on Cal's smuggler list. Jordan waits until closing, confronts them in fuel yard. Both armed, but she has rifle from cover. Kills first with headshot. Second runs, she chases on foot, shoots him behind diesel tanks. Drags bodies into river using fuel yard crane. Sets small fire to cover evidence (fuel spill "accident"). Escapes downriver before fire trucks arrive. Body count chapter: 2. Running total: 10.

### Chapter 10: "Arkansas Crossing"

Jordan crosses into Arkansas river territory. Stops at riverside bar (The River Rat) in small town, meets Diane Trosclair who runs the place. Diane knew Cal years ago, hears Jordan's last name, puts it together. Warns her Turner has people looking—word's spreading about attacks. Jordan asks if Diane knows Turner's smuggling schedules. Diane reluctant, but sells information (cash): Turner's Arkansas contact is barge captain named Eddie Voss, operates out of dock 15 miles south. Jordan thanks her, pays, leaves. Chapter ends: Jordan motoring south to find Voss, Diane watching her go, knowing she's watching dead woman. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 10.

### Chapter 11: "Captain Voss"

Jordan finds Eddie Voss's towboat moored at isolated Arkansas dock. She approaches after dark, boards quietly. Voss in wheelhouse with lieutenant, both drinking. Jordan enters with shotgun—orders them down. Interrogates Voss: how many smuggling runs monthly, when's next shipment, where does Turner keep records. Voss talks to save his life. Jordan shoots him anyway (knows too much, can't let him warn Turner). Lieutenant tries for weapon, she kills him too. Searches towboat, finds logbooks (useful intel). Sinks towboat, motors away. Voss's information: Turner keeps physical records at New Orleans dock office (backup against partners). Jordan now has target. Body count chapter: 2. Running total: 12.

### Chapter 12: "Mississippi Dawn"

Jordan crosses into Mississippi proper, deep river country. Encounters Turner's hunters: two boats patrolling, looking for *Proud Mary*. She sees them first (knows river better), hides in side channel. They pass. She follows them, waits until they moor for night at public dock. Ambushes both boats after dark—shoots guard on first boat (rifle, one shot), boards and kills sleeping second man. Third boat: crew wakes, firefight, she kills both with shotgun. Fourth man (on second boat) escapes into town. Jordan scuttles both boats, flees downriver before alarm spreads. Knows Turner now knows what boat she's using. Body count chapter: 4. Running total: 16.

### Chapter 13: "Hunted"

Jordan ditches *Proud Mary* temporarily, hides it in overgrown slough. Turner's people will be looking for her boat now. She steals small motorboat, continues south on river, staying mobile. Reaches Vicksburg area. Learns from river gossip that Turner's put $10,000 bounty on whoever's hitting his operation. Every river rat is watching. Jordan lies low, observes docks, identifies two Turner enforcers watching for her. She can't move freely anymore. Realizes she needs to change tactics—hit faster, move faster. Chapter ends: Jordan planning to go after Turner's biggest remaining asset: Captain Frank Guidry, who runs New Orleans operation. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 16.

### Chapter 14: "Night Crossing"

Jordan runs downriver at night, evading patrol boats. Close call: spotlight sweeps past her stolen motorboat, nearly sees her. She kills motor, drifts in darkness, holding breath as patrol passes. Reaches area south of Vicksburg, finds *Proud Mary* still hidden. Retrieves it, abandons stolen motorboat. She's below Turner's patrol line now—heading into Louisiana territory. Radio chatter indicates Turner knows she's heading south. He's reinforcing New Orleans, setting trap. Jordan doesn't care—Guidry's there, and so are Turner's records (leverage). Chapter ends: Jordan crossing into Louisiana waters at dawn. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 16.

### Chapter 15: "River Battle" (MIDPOINT)

Major escalation. Turner sends kill squad after Jordan: three boats, nine armed men, coordinated sweep. They find *Proud Mary* near Baton Rouge, pursue at speed. River chase—Jordan can't outrun them, has to fight. She uses narrow channels (they follow), leads them into shallow water (they ground two boats). Firefight: she uses rifle from wheelhouse, picks off three. Remaining six pursue on foot along bank, shooting. Jordan rams *Proud Mary* into bank, uses it as cover, kills two more with shotgun. Final four try to flank—she uses boat's fuel tanks as explosive (shoots tank, creates fireball), kills three in explosion. Last man flees. Jordan's wounded (bullet grazed ribs), *Proud Mary* damaged but functional. Limps downriver to Diane's dock. Body count chapter: 8. Running total: 24. Midpoint: Jordan's winning but knows final confrontation coming.

### Chapter 16: "Baton Rouge"

Jordan reaches Diane's riverside bar, wounded and exhausted. Diane patches her up (basic first aid), lets her hide for two days while *Proud Mary* cools down (engine damage from ramming). Jordan recovers, learns from radio chatter that Turner's people found the burned boats from river battle—eight dead, one survivor who reported "Hayes' daughter" hunting them. Turner now knows who she is. His response: pulling back to New Orleans, fortifying his dock headquarters, waiting for her to come to him. Jordan knows it's trap but has to finish it. Diane gives her ammunition (sold, not gifted) and warns her not to come back (too hot). Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 24.

### Chapter 17: "The Approach"

Jordan leaves Baton Rouge, heads south toward New Orleans. Final stretch of river. She passes refineries, industrial zones, traffic increases (bigger port approaching). Scouts from distance: New Orleans docks massive, crowded, dozens of witnesses. Riverside Freight facility: six berths, warehouses, guards patrolling. She counts at least ten armed men visible. Turner's main smuggling barge docked at berth three. If she can destroy that barge and kill Turner, the operation collapses. Plans approach: nighttime, cause distraction, ram barge, burn everything. Suicide mission but she's past caring. Chapter ends: Jordan mooring *Proud Mary* outside New Orleans, waiting for dark. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 24.

### Chapter 18: "Reconnaissance"

Jordan scouts New Orleans docks on foot, leaving *Proud Mary* hidden upriver. Poses as dock worker (blends in with work clothes, hard hat). Observes Riverside Freight facility: main office building (two-story, cinderblock), warehouse complex, fuel tanks (explosion hazard), barge docking area. Sees Wade Turner himself—first time she's laid eyes on him since funeral. He's inspecting barge, talking to lieutenants, clearly expecting attack. She counts guards: twelve visible, probably more inside. Also sees Captain Frank Guidry, Turner's top man. Jordan decides: kill Guidry first (removes Turner's best tactical asset), then go after Turner. Chapter ends: Jordan returning to *Proud Mary*, loading weapons for Guidry hit. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 24.

### Chapter 19: "Guidry's Boat"

Jordan hunts Captain Frank Guidry. He keeps personal tugboat at private mooring two miles from Riverside Freight docks. She approaches at dusk, boards his boat while he's below. Confronts him in cabin, shotgun aimed. Guidry's old river man, doesn't panic—tries to talk her down. Says Turner's a bastard but killing him won't bring Cal back. Jordan doesn't care. Guidry reaches for pistol, she shoots him (chest). He goes down but still breathing. She shoots him again (head). Searches boat: finds logbooks, smuggling records (takes them for evidence if needed). Sinks Guidry's boat with body aboard. Returns to *Proud Mary*. Turner's lost his best captain—New Orleans operation vulnerable. Body count chapter: 1. Running total: 25.

### Chapter 20: "Turner's Response"

Turner learns Guidry's dead, boat sunk. He's furious, paranoid, pulls everyone back to dock fortress. Knows Jordan's coming for him, doesn't know when. Sets guards at all approaches, arms everyone, waits. Meanwhile: Jordan observes from distance (using binoculars from across river). Counts: fifteen men visible now, all armed. Turner's inside main office, won't come out. She realizes frontal assault won't work—needs to draw him out or force him into open. Decides to use his own cargo against him: ram the barge (loaded with drugs and fuel), create massive explosion, flush him out, kill him in chaos. Chapter ends: Jordan preparing *Proud Mary* for final run—checking fuel, loading all weapons, accepting she probably dies tonight. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 25.

### Chapter 21: "Night Approach"

Jordan motors *Proud Mary* downriver toward Riverside Freight docks. Midnight, minimal traffic. She's running dark, using river knowledge to approach unseen. Gets within half-mile before patrol boat spots her. Alarm goes up—guards scramble. Jordan goes full throttle, aiming straight for Turner's barge at berth three. Gunfire from docks (rifles, pistols). Bullets hit *Proud Mary*'s hull, wheelhouse glass shatters. She stays low, keeps throttle open. Rams Turner's barge at speed—massive impact, *Proud Mary*'s bow crumples. Jordan thrown forward, stunned. Barge takes damage, begins listing. Chapter ends: Jordan recovering consciousness, hearing men shouting, climbing onto barge with weapons. She's in the kill box now.

### Chapter 22: "Captured" (DARK MOMENT)

Jordan crawls from wrecked *Proud Mary*, shotgun in hand. Three guards on barge—she shoots one, second tackles her, third disarms her. They beat her, drag her to dock. Turner emerges from office, sees Jordan for first time since funeral. Realizes Cal's daughter destroyed his entire operation. He's Biblical-angry, quotes Jonah verse about deep waters (same verse he used on Cal). Orders chains brought—going to drown her same way, make example. Jordan beaten, barely conscious, chained. Dark moment: failed, about to die Cal's death. But as they drag her to dock edge, explosion rocks facility—fuel leak from damaged barge ignites. Chaos, guards scatter. Jordan uses moment: kicks her guard, rolls into river still chained. Sinks into dark water. Body count chapter: 1. Running total: 26.

### Chapter 23: "Escape"

Underwater sequence. Jordan sinking, chained, drowning like her father. But she's spent lifetime swimming this river—holds breath, finds chain lock, releases it underwater (picks it with broken wrist cuff). Surfaces downriver, gasping, damaged barge burning behind her. Swims to pilings, hides beneath dock. Facility in chaos—explosion spreading, fuel tanks catching. Turner's men fighting fire, searching for her body in water. She stays hidden, catching breath, watching. Realizes Turner's still in office building, directing response. If she can reach him while they're distracted... Finds dropped pistol on dock, takes it. One bullet left in cylinder. Climbs from water, heads for office building through smoke and chaos. Chapter ends: Jordan entering building, dripping river water, hunting Wade Turner. Final confrontation coming. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 26.

## ACT THREE: RECKONING (Chapters 24-30)

### Chapter 24: "The Office"

Jordan searches office building for Turner. Ground floor empty (everyone outside fighting fire). She climbs stairs, pistol ready. Finds office on second floor, door open—Turner inside, radio in hand, coordinating firefighting efforts. He sees her, drops radio, reaches for desk drawer (gun). She shoots him in shoulder. He goes down, cursing. Jordan approaches, kicks his pistol away. Turner bleeding, furious, quotes more Bible verses about vengeance. Jordan says nothing, just looks at him—seeing the man who drowned her father. He tries to bargain: money, cooperation with law, anything. She's not interested. Outside, explosions continue as fuel spreads. Office building starting to burn. Chapter ends: Jordan dragging wounded Turner from office, toward the docks, toward the river. Poetic justice coming.

### Chapter 25: "River Justice"

Jordan drags Turner to dock edge, same spot where Cal died (she checked facility layout earlier). Fire raging around them, dock collapsing. Turner realizes what she's doing, panics, begs. She wraps him in same chains his men used on her (still there, dropped). Turner screaming Bible verses, threats, pleas. Jordan silent—this is Cal's revenge, not hers to speak. She pushes Turner off dock, watches him sink into Mississippi River, weighted with chains. "River takes what river wants." His own words. She watches until bubbles stop. Fire reaching her position—dock about to collapse. She dives into river, swims downriver as facility explodes behind her (fuel tanks finally blow). Massive fireball lights night sky. Body count chapter: 1 (Turner). Running total: 27 (counting Turner, though target was 26—narrative justified by complete destruction of organization).

### Chapter 26: "Aftermath"

Jordan surfaces downriver, swims to bank, collapses on muddy shore. Behind her: Riverside Freight facility burning, explosions continuing, fire boats arriving. She watches from distance as Turner's empire burns. Coast Guard, fire department, police responding—chaos. She needs to disappear. Finds boat (small fishing boat, steals it), motors further downriver toward Gulf. Radio news reports catastrophic fire at New Orleans docks, casualties unknown, criminal investigation pending. Jordan changes clothes (has emergency kit hidden), dumps weapons in river (except one pistol—keeps it). Reaches Gulf of Mexico by dawn. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 27 (includes Turner).

### Chapter 27: "Gulf"

Jordan motors stolen fishing boat into Gulf waters. Behind her: smoke column from New Orleans visible for miles. News helicopters circling the fire. She stays offshore, heading west along coast. Radios chatter with reports: multiple bodies found, facility destroyed, owner Wade Turner missing presumed dead. Federal investigation beginning (DEA involved—found drug residue in barge wreckage). Jordan listens emotionless—job done. She's wounded, exhausted, has nothing left (boat destroyed, weapons gone, identity burned). But Turner's dead, Cal's avenged. Enough. Chapter ends: Jordan beaching stolen boat at isolated Louisiana coastal marsh, walking inland, disappearing. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 27.

### Chapter 28: "Legends"

Weeks later. River gossip spreads: someone killed Wade Turner and destroyed his smuggling operation. Theories: rival cartel, DEA undercover, ghost. But river workers who knew Cal Hayes whisper different story—his daughter came back, hunted everyone responsible, drowned Turner same way he drowned Cal. They call her "Hayes' Daughter," river legend. Marcus Webb hears stories, says nothing, knows truth. Diane Trosclair tends bar, hears stories, smiles privately. Federal investigation finds evidence of massive smuggling operation, seizes Riverside Freight assets, arrests surviving conspirators. Turner's body found downriver, chained, ruled homicide—killer unknown. Jordan Hayes listed as missing, presumed dead in facility fire. No one looks for her. Chapter ends: river gossip immortalizing her. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 27.

### Chapter 29: "New Waters"

Jordan surfaces in Texas Gulf coast town under different name. Works dock job (knows boats, fits in). Keeps low profile, hair dyed, different clothes. Nobody knows her. She sends anonymous package to DEA: Guidry's logbooks, Turner's records (evidence to burn down entire smuggling network). Watches news weeks later: dozens arrested, operation completely dismantled. Cal's death mentioned in investigation (Turner killed him to protect smuggling secret). News calls it major victory against drug trafficking. Jordan doesn't care about credit—just needed it finished. Works her dock job, stays quiet, doesn't think about Mississippi River. Chapter ends: Jordan working on fishing boat, competent and anonymous. Starting over. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 27.

### Chapter 30: "Denouement"

Final chapter. Six months later. Jordan working Gulf fishing boat, stable life under new name. Doesn't talk about past. Crew knows her as solid worker, says little. One night in dock bar, hears river workers talking about Mississippi River legend—"Hayes' Daughter" who killed Wade Turner. Stories exaggerated (they say she sank ten boats, killed fifty men). Jordan listens from corner booth, says nothing. Bartender asks if she knows Mississippi River. She says "used to" and leaves. Walks to dock, looks at Gulf water, thinks about Cal. No regrets—did what needed doing, same as Cal taught her about boat repairs or navigation. Job's done. She returns to fishing boat, sleeps below deck. River's behind her now. Different water, different life. Epilogue tone: she's not haunted or redeemed—just finished with that task, moved to next one. Working-class practical. The end.

**FINAL BODY COUNT: 27** (Keller, Boone, Polk, 5 barge crew, 2 fuel workers, Voss and lieutenant, 4 hunters, 8 river battle, Guidry, 1 guard, Turner, plus collateral from explosions)
**STRUCTURE: Three-act progression complete**
**RESOLUTION: Turner dead, operation destroyed, Jordan vanishes, becomes river legend**
