# DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINES: RIVER REVENGE (Chapters 16-30)

## Chapter 16: "Baton Rouge"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: The River Rat bar and dock, Baton Rouge
Time: Sunday evening through Tuesday morning

* **Purpose:** Recovery chapter allowing Jordan to heal while Turner learns her identity and sets New Orleans trap.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan reaches Diane's dock wounded and exhausted, *Proud Mary* smoking from damaged engine, collapses on arrival.
  - Diane patches her up (basic first aid, bandages, painkillers from bar stock), lets her hide in back room while *Proud Mary* cools down at dock.
  - Jordan recovers for two days, listens to river radio chatter—Turner's people found burned boats from battle, eight dead, survivor reported "Hayes' daughter" hunting them.
  - Turner now knows exactly who she is, response is pulling everyone back to New Orleans dock headquarters, fortifying position, waiting for her.
  - Diane gives Jordan ammunition (sells boxes of shells and rifle rounds, cash transaction) and tells her not to come back (too hot, danger follows Jordan now).

* **Dialogue Topics:** Diane's medical questions (where hit, how bad), Jordan's minimal responses, radio chatter details (survivor's report, Turner's orders), Diane's warning about New Orleans trap, Jordan's acknowledgment and thanks.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan allowing herself brief vulnerability (wounded, exhausted, accepts help), gratitude for Diane's no-questions professionalism. Hardens again hearing Turner knows who she is—no more anonymity, final confrontation inevitable.

* **Key Details:** Diane's back room (cot, first aid supplies, river charts on wall), wound care specifics (alcohol, bandages, pain from broken rib), *Proud Mary* repair attempts (engine partially fixed, still rough), radio reports (specific language about "Cal Hayes' daughter," Turner's voice on frequency), ammunition transaction (three boxes 12-gauge, two boxes .30-06, one box .357), Diane's final goodbye (handshake, mutual respect).

## Chapter 17: "The Approach"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Mississippi River approaching New Orleans, Industrial Canal area
Time: Wednesday, traveling downstream

* **Purpose:** Setup for final act—Jordan scouts the trap while committing fully to confrontation despite knowing odds.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan leaves Baton Rouge on *Proud Mary*, motors south toward New Orleans on final stretch of river, passes refineries and increasing industrial development.
  - River traffic increases (oceangoing ships, major port operations), Jordan scouts from distance using binoculars—New Orleans docks massive and crowded.
  - Locates Riverside Freight facility at Industrial Canal: six berths, warehouse complex, guards visible, Turner's main smuggling barge docked at berth three.
  - Counts at least ten armed men patrolling, knows there are more inside—this is fortified position, Turner waiting for her.
  - Plans approach: nighttime attack, create distraction, ram barge loaded with drugs and fuel, cause explosion, kill Turner in chaos—accepts this is likely suicide mission.

* **Dialogue Topics:** River traffic radio chatter (commercial traffic, port operations), Jordan's internal tactical planning (voiced minimally aloud to herself), brief exchange with fuel dock attendant (routine transaction).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan calm and resolved—final target in sight, no hesitation despite odds. Brief moment acknowledging she'll probably die but considers it acceptable price. Focused entirely on mission completion.

* **Key Details:** New Orleans approach (refineries across river, Folgers coffee plant smell, salt air from Gulf), Industrial Canal layout (warehouses, cranes, commercial docks), Riverside Freight facility specifics (cinderblock office building two-story, fuel tank locations, barge mooring configuration), guard count and positions, Turner's barge details (large cargo barge, modified with drug compartments), *Proud Mary* final preparations (checking fuel, loading all weapons, writing brief note about Turner's crimes).

## Chapter 18: "Reconnaissance"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: New Orleans docks, on foot reconnaissance
Time: Thursday morning

* **Purpose:** Jordan infiltrates on foot to gather final intelligence and sees Wade Turner for first time since funeral—personalizes final confrontation.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan leaves *Proud Mary* hidden upriver, scouts Riverside Freight facility on foot posing as dock worker (work clothes, hard hat borrowed, blends in).
  - Observes layout: office building (Turner's headquarters), warehouse (drug storage likely), fuel tanks (explosion hazard and opportunity), barge docking system.
  - Sees Wade Turner himself inspecting barge with lieutenants—first time since funeral, recognizing his voice from radio, physical presence (barrel-chested, cigar, commanding).
  - Counts guards more accurately: twelve visible outside, probably six-eight inside, all armed with pistols and shotguns, coordinated patrol patterns.
  - Identifies Captain Frank Guidry (Turner's top man, runs New Orleans operation)—decides to eliminate him first, remove Turner's best tactical asset before final assault.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Dock worker small talk (Jordan fitting in, minimal responses), Turner's orders to lieutenants (overheard from distance), guard conversations (Jordan eavesdropping about patrol schedules), brief question to another worker about Guidry (where does captain keep his boat).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan's cold focus seeing Turner—confirms he's the target, watching him alive while Cal's dead hardens her resolve. Tactical mindset overrides rage—smart to kill Guidry first, then hit Turner.

* **Key Details:** Dock worker disguise (borrowed hard hat, clipboard, blending technique), facility layout mapping (mental notes, no written records), Turner's physical presence (missing ear chunk, work boots, commanding voice), Guidry identification (50s, Cajun features, confident bearing), guard weapons and patterns (shift changes, blind spots), fuel tank locations (tactical opportunity), *Proud Mary*'s hidden mooring location.

## Chapter 19: "Guidry's Boat"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Private mooring two miles from Riverside Freight docks
Time: Thursday evening into night

* **Purpose:** Eliminate Turner's top lieutenant and acquire final intelligence from his logbooks—removing tactical obstacle before main assault.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan locates Captain Frank Guidry's personal tugboat at private mooring (learned location from dock gossip), approaches at dusk.
  - Boards quietly while Guidry below deck, confronts him in cabin with shotgun—Guidry experienced river man, doesn't panic.
  - Guidry tries talking her down, says Turner's a bastard but killing him won't bring Cal back, offers to disappear (save his own life).
  - Jordan unmoved, Guidry reaches for pistol on shelf, she shoots him chest, he goes down still breathing, she shoots him head (clinical finish).
  - Searches boat thoroughly, finds logbooks with smuggling records and Turner's operation details, sinks Guidry's boat with body aboard, returns to *Proud Mary*.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Guidry's attempted negotiation (calm, reasonable tone), brief discussion about Cal (Guidry claims he wasn't involved in drowning, just ran transport), Jordan's questions about Turner's security (extracting info even while planning to kill), Guidry's final attempt ("You don't have to do this").

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan respects Guidry's competence (old professional, not panicked) but killing him is tactical necessity. Brief moment of almost-regret (he seems more reasonable than Turner's other people) but proceeds—can't leave competent enemy alive.

* **Key Details:** Private mooring (residential dock, quiet neighborhood), Guidry's tugboat (well-maintained 40-footer, professional operation), cabin interior (charts, radio, coffee pot), Guidry's calm reaction (survival instinct, tries talking first), pistol position (within reach, obvious trap), shotgun work (close range, two shots, efficiency), logbook contents (routes, dates, payments, Turner's signatures), boat sinking (seacocks opened, slow flooding).

## Chapter 20: "Turner's Response"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: *Proud Mary* and observation position across from Riverside Freight
Time: Friday morning through evening

* **Purpose:** Turner's paranoia peaks after Guidry's death while Jordan finalizes suicide assault plan—calm before climax.

* **Beats:**
  - Turner learns Guidry's dead and boat sunk (Friday morning discovery), furious and paranoid, pulls everyone back to dock fortress.
  - Turner arms all remaining crew (fifteen men now), posts guards at all approaches, won't leave office building—waiting for Jordan's attack.
  - Jordan observes from across river using binoculars, counts guards and weapons, notes Turner staying inside (can't draw him out easily).
  - Realizes frontal assault won't work—decides to ram Turner's drug barge, create massive explosion, force Turner into open or die in fire.
  - Prepares *Proud Mary* for final run: checks fuel (enough for ramming speed), loads all weapons within reach, accepts probable death, removes Cal's river watch from her neck (only personal item—leaves it hidden in cabin as memorial).

* **Dialogue Topics:** Radio chatter about Guidry's death (Turner's angry orders, crew's nervous acknowledgment), Jordan's minimal self-talk (tactical calculations spoken aloud), internal acceptance of death (mostly unspoken, shown through actions).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan moves past fear into calm acceptance—this is the job's final task, complete it or die trying. Brief moment of sentiment (Cal's watch) then back to tactical focus. Professional approach to death.

* **Key Details:** Discovery scene (Guidry's boat found sunken, body visible through water), Turner's radio voice (Biblical fury, Jonah quotes again), guard reinforcement (specific positions, overlapping fields of fire), observation details (Jordan across river with binocs, noting everything), *Proud Mary* preparation (fuel check, weapons laid out in wheelhouse, engine maintenance), Cal's watch (worn steel, stopped at time of his death, Jordan's only keepsake).

## Chapter 21: "Night Approach"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Mississippi River to Riverside Freight docks
Time: Friday midnight

* **Purpose:** Jordan's final approach and ramming attack—entering the kill box deliberately, embracing chaos.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan motors *Proud Mary* downriver toward Riverside Freight at midnight, running dark, using river knowledge for final approach.
  - Gets within half-mile before patrol boat spots her (searchlight), alarm goes up immediately—guards scramble, Turner alerted.
  - Jordan goes full throttle straight at Turner's barge at berth three, gunfire erupts from docks (rifles, pistols, muzzle flashes everywhere).
  - Bullets hit *Proud Mary* throughout approach—wheelhouse glass shatters, hull impacts, Jordan stays low keeping throttle open despite fire.
  - Rams Turner's barge at full speed—massive impact, *Proud Mary*'s bow crumples, Jordan thrown forward against wheel, stunned, ears ringing from collision.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Patrol boat alarm shouts, guard radio traffic (coordinated response), Turner's voice on radio ordering fire, Jordan's cursing during approach (adrenaline, fear, determination).

* **Emotional Arc:** Pure adrenaline and commitment—Jordan beyond fear now, just executing plan. Terror during bullet impacts (glass shattering around her) but pushes through. Stunning impact transitions to disorientation.

* **Key Details:** Night river approach (darkness, spotlight sweeping, distance closing), patrol boat alarm (horn, radio calls, scrambling), gunfire specifics (muzzle flashes from docks, bullet impacts on steel hull, wheelhouse glass exploding), *Proud Mary* at ramming speed (engines screaming, bow wave, unstoppable momentum), collision mechanics (steel on steel, grinding, tearing, Jordan's body thrown forward), post-impact disorientation (ears ringing, vision blurred, blood from head wound).

## Chapter 22: "Captured" (DARK MOMENT)

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Turner's barge and Riverside Freight dock
Time: Friday midnight, immediately following crash

* **Purpose:** Dark moment—Jordan captured and facing Cal's death, but explosion creates escape opportunity showing her resourcefulness.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan recovers consciousness in crashed *Proud Mary*, climbs onto Turner's barge with shotgun, three guards waiting—she shoots one before second tackles her.
  - Guards beat and disarm her, drag her to dock where Wade Turner emerges from office, sees Jordan for first time since funeral.
  - Turner realizes Cal's daughter destroyed his entire operation, Biblical fury, quotes Jonah verse about deep waters (same verse used on Cal).
  - Orders chains brought to drown Jordan same method—guards wrap her while she's beaten and dazed, dark moment of complete failure.
  - As they drag her to dock edge, fuel leak from damaged barge ignites—massive explosion rocks facility, chaos, guards scatter.
  - Jordan uses moment: kicks nearest guard's knee, rolls into river still chained, sinks into dark water like her father did.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Guards' shouted orders during capture, Turner's Biblical rage monologue (quoting scripture, calling her sinner and destroyer), Jordan's defiant silence, Turner's orders to chain and drown her, explosion chaos (screaming, confusion).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan's brief hope (boarded with shotgun) crashes to despair (beaten, captured). Facing exact death as Cal—terror and rage combined. Explosion creates desperate hope, chooses drowning on own terms over Turner's execution.

* **Key Details:** Shotgun kill (one guard down before tackle), beating details (ribs, face, disarming), Turner's appearance (triumphant, angry, Biblical), chain wrapping (40-pound industrial chains, same type as Cal's), fuel leak source (barge damage from ramming, diesel spreading), explosion ignition (spark, fireball, shockwave), Jordan's desperate move (kicking guard, rolling into river), sinking with chains (weight pulling down, darkness closing).

## Chapter 23: "Escape"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Underwater and beneath dock pilings
Time: Friday midnight, continuing immediately

* **Purpose:** Jordan's underwater escape demonstrates her river skills while setting up final Turner confrontation—hope restored.

* **Beats:**
  - Underwater sinking, chained, drowning like Cal did—Jordan's lifetime swimming Mississippi saves her, holds breath (can hold two minutes from practice).
  - Finds chain lock underwater, picks it with broken wrist cuff piece (desperation and skill), releases chains, kicks for surface.
  - Surfaces downriver from facility (current carried her), gasping and wounded, sees facility burning—explosion spreading to fuel tanks.
  - Swims to pilings beneath dock, hides there catching breath, facility in chaos above—Turner's men fighting fire, searching water for her body.
  - Spots dropped pistol on dock during chaos, climbs up quietly, takes it (one round left in cylinder), heads toward office building through smoke—Turner still inside directing response.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Jordan's internal survival dialogue (coaching herself through lock-picking, breath-holding), distant shouts from facility (fire-fighting, searching for her), Turner's voice audible (directing fire response, assuming she drowned).

* **Emotional Arc:** Primal survival underwater (terror, determination, skill combining), relief surfacing (gasping, alive), rage returning seeing facility burning—Turner's still alive, job incomplete. Final resolve: finish it now.

* **Key Details:** Underwater specifics (darkness, pressure, chain weight, lungs burning), lock-picking technique (using broken cuff edge, feeling tumblers, desperation precision), surfacing (gulping air, river water taste, current distance), facility fire (spreading from initial explosion, fuel tanks catching, orange glow), hiding beneath dock (pilings, shadows, water lapping), pistol acquisition (Colt .45, one round visible in cylinder), climbing onto dock (dripping, wounded, smoke cover).

## Chapter 24: "The Office"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Riverside Freight office building
Time: Friday night, fire ongoing

* **Purpose:** Jordan confronts Turner directly—shoots him but doesn't kill yet, sets up river justice finale.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan enters office building through smoke and chaos (everyone outside fighting fire), dripping river water, pistol in hand.
  - Climbs stairs to second floor, finds Turner's office—door open, Turner inside with radio directing firefighting efforts.
  - Turner sees her (ghost rising from river), drops radio in shock, reaches for desk drawer (gun), Jordan shoots him in shoulder.
  - Turner goes down bleeding, cursing and quoting Bible verses about vengeance and deep waters, Jordan approaches and kicks his pistol away.
  - Looks at him (man who drowned her father), Turner tries bargaining (money, information for police, anything), Jordan silent—drags wounded Turner from office toward docks as building burns.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Turner's radio orders (overheard during Jordan's approach), his shocked recognition ("You drowned"), his Biblical curses while wounded, bargaining attempts (increasingly desperate offers), Jordan's silence (lets actions speak).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan cold and focused entering building—this is completion of task. Shooting Turner provides brief satisfaction but not enough—he needs Cal's death, not quick bullet. Dragging him toward river feels right (poetic justice).

* **Key Details:** Office building interior (stairs, smoke filling, heat from fire), Turner's office (desk, radio, maps, cigar smell), Turner's shocked reaction (seeing Jordan dripping wet, alive), pistol in desk drawer (too slow), shoulder wound (bleeding, painful, disabling), office fire spreading (ceiling catching, time pressure), dragging Turner (by shirt, stairs, his blood trail).

## Chapter 25: "River Justice"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Riverside Freight dock edge
Time: Friday night, facility burning

* **Purpose:** Execute Turner via river burial—completing revenge arc with poetic justice, Jordan escapes during massive explosion.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan drags Turner to specific dock edge (same spot where Cal died—she verified during reconnaissance), facility burning around them.
  - Wraps Turner in chains (same chains his men used on her, dropped during explosion chaos), Turner panicking and begging (Biblical verses, threats, pleas mixed).
  - Turner screaming about God's vengeance and deep waters, Jordan silent throughout—this is Cal's revenge, not hers to speak.
  - Pushes Turner off dock into Mississippi River, weighted with chains, watches him sink—"River takes what river wants" (his own words back at him).
  - Watches until bubbles stop (Turner drowned), fire reaching her position, dock collapsing—dives into river as fuel tanks explode behind her (massive fireball).
  - Swims downriver as facility destroys itself above, surfaces exhausted on muddy bank downstream.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Turner's panicked begging (Bible verses, offers, threats, terror), Jordan's single line ("River takes what river wants"), explosion aftermath (sirens approaching, distant shouts).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan cold and mechanical wrapping Turner—this is work completion, not emotional release. Brief satisfaction watching him sink (Cal avenged), then exhaustion. Swimming away feels like shedding weight (revenge complete, now just survival).

* **Key Details:** Dock location (same spot as Cal's death, Jordan confirmed earlier), chain wrapping (Turner struggling, Jordan methodical), Turner's drowning (eyes wide, sinking, chains pulling), bubbles stopping (confirming death), dock collapse (fire weakening structure), fuel tank explosion (massive blast, fireball lighting sky, shockwave), swim escape (Jordan exhausted, wounded, running on empty), muddy bank (collapsing there, watching facility burn from distance).

## Chapter 26: "Aftermath"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Downriver from New Orleans, moving toward Gulf
Time: Friday night into Saturday dawn

* **Purpose:** Immediate aftermath—Jordan escapes while authorities respond to facility destruction, begins disappearing process.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan recovers on muddy riverbank, watches Riverside Freight burn (explosions continuing, fire boats arriving, sirens everywhere).
  - Needs to disappear quickly—finds small fishing boat moored nearby (steals it), motors further downriver toward Gulf of Mexico.
  - Listens to radio news reports: catastrophic fire at New Orleans docks, casualties unknown, criminal investigation pending, facility destroyed.
  - Jordan changes clothes (has emergency kit hidden in stolen boat's storage), dumps remaining weapons in river except one pistol (keeps for protection).
  - Reaches Gulf of Mexico by Saturday dawn, sees smoke column from New Orleans visible for miles behind her, news helicopters circling.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Radio news reports (reporters describing fire, officials commenting, casualty speculation), Coast Guard radio traffic (coordinating response), Jordan's minimal self-talk (tactical planning for disappearance).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan numb and exhausted—revenge complete but no triumph, just emptiness. Mechanical focus on escape and survival. Brief moment watching smoke knowing Turner's dead before pushing forward.

* **Key Details:** Riverbank recovery (mud, exhaustion, wounds painful), facility burning (multiple explosions, massive fire, emergency response), stolen fishing boat (16-foot, outboard motor, worn), radio reports specifics (fire size, response, speculation about causes), weapon disposal (rifle, shotgun into river, keeping .38 revolver), clothes change (burns dock worker disguise, uses spare jeans and shirt), Gulf approach (water changing character, salt smell, wider horizon), smoke column (visible 20 miles, black against dawn sky).

## Chapter 27: "Gulf"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan motors stolen boat west along Gulf coast staying offshore, behind her smoke column from New Orleans visible for miles.
  - Radio news updates throughout day: multiple bodies found in facility wreckage, owner Wade Turner missing presumed dead, evidence of criminal activity.
  - Federal investigation beginning (DEA involved—drug residue found in destroyed barge), Riverside Freight assets seized, surviving crew members arrested.
  - Jordan listens emotionless while running parallel to coast—job done, Turner dead, operation destroyed, Cal avenged. Has nothing left (boat destroyed, identity burned, wounded).
  - Sunday afternoon beaches stolen boat at isolated Louisiana coastal marsh, walks inland leaving boat behind, disappearing into bayou country.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Extended radio news coverage (reporters, officials, witness accounts), DEA spokesman (confirming smuggling investigation), survivor interviews (Turner's arrested crew), Jordan's internal monologue (minimal, accepting completion).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan empty and mechanical—watching news confirms success but brings no joy. Accepts she's sacrificed her identity and life for revenge (worth it to her). Ready to disappear completely.

* **Key Details:** Gulf waters (different from river, waves, salt, seabirds), coastal running (staying offshore, parallel to land, navigation by coast features), radio coverage details (body count estimates, Turner named, smuggling operation revealed), stolen boat condition (low fuel, battered), coastal marsh (cypress and saw grass, isolated, no development), boat abandonment (wiped for prints, left moored), walking inland (backpack with cash and spare clothes, wounds still painful).

## Chapter 28: "Legends"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person (brief) transitioning to omniscient river gossip
Setting: Various Mississippi River locations
Time: Weeks later, October 1978

* **Purpose:** Show river legend building while investigations conclude—Jordan's actions have consequences beyond personal revenge.

* **Beats:**
  - Weeks pass. River gossip spreads about someone who killed Wade Turner and destroyed his smuggling empire—theories: rival cartel, DEA undercover operation, ghost.
  - River workers who knew Cal Hayes whisper different story—his daughter came back, hunted everyone responsible, drowned Turner same way he drowned Cal.
  - They call her "Hayes' Daughter" (river legend, woman who fought Turner's army alone and won), stories exaggerate (claim she sank ten boats, killed fifty men).
  - Marcus Webb hears stories at Memphis docks, says nothing, knows truth. Diane Trosclair tends bar hearing stories, smiles privately, serves drinks.
  - Federal investigation concludes: massive smuggling operation dismantled, dozens arrested, Turner's body found downriver (chained, ruled homicide—killer unknown), Jordan Hayes listed missing presumed dead in facility fire.

* **Dialogue Topics:** River workers' gossip (speculation, theories, legend-building), Marcus Webb's non-committal responses, Diane's deflections, news reports (investigation conclusions), federal spokesman (operation dismantled, arrests made).

* **Emotional Arc:** Omniscient satisfaction—river community knows rough justice was served. Those who knew Jordan keep her secret. Authorities get their victory (smuggling ring destroyed). Everyone's needs met except truth.

* **Key Details:** Various river locations (Memphis docks, Vicksburg bars, Baton Rouge fuel stops), gossip details (exaggerated stories, kernel of truth), Webb's knowing silence (working barges, hearing stories, protecting Jordan's memory), Diane's private knowledge (serving drinks, changing subject when asked), Turner's body discovery (downriver, chains still attached, autopsy showing drowning), federal press conference (DEA success, operation scope revealed), Jordan's official status (missing presumed dead, no search).

## Chapter 29: "New Waters"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Texas Gulf coast town
Time: November 1978, six weeks after Turner's death

* **Purpose:** Jordan's new life established—she's survived and started over under new identity, sends evidence to finish job.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan surfaces in Texas Gulf coast town (Corpus Christi area) under different name (Sarah Miller), works dock job on commercial fishing boat.
  - Hair dyed dark, different clothes, keeps low profile—nobody knows her, she's just competent dock worker who knows boats.
  - Sends anonymous package to DEA New Orleans office: Guidry's logbooks and Turner's records (complete evidence to burn down entire remaining network).
  - Watches news weeks later: dozens more arrested based on evidence, smuggling network completely dismantled, Cal Hayes' death mentioned (Turner killed him to protect operation).
  - News calls it major victory against drug trafficking. Jordan doesn't care about credit—just needed Turner dead and operation destroyed, both complete.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Fishing boat crew small talk (Jordan minimal responses, fitting in), dock boss instructions (work assignments), news coverage (arrests, network scope, Cal mentioned), Jordan's brief self-talk (confirming mission complete).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan finding stability in anonymity—work is familiar (boats, water, physical labor), asks nothing more. Brief satisfaction seeing news (job truly finished) then back to quiet life. No regrets.

* **Key Details:** Texas coast town (working docks, fishing fleet, anonymous community), new identity (Social Security card forged, driver's license, paid cash for documents), physical changes (dark hair, different style, tan from outdoor work), fishing boat work (deck hand, competent, accepted by crew), anonymous package (mailed from Houston, no return address, logbooks and records), news coverage (federal success, network destroyed, Cal's name vindicated).

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Texas Gulf coast, dock bar
Time: March 1979, six months after Turner's death

* **Purpose:** Final chapter—Jordan's settled into new life, hears her own legend, accepts completion without dwelling. Working-class practical ending.

* **Beats:**
  - Six months later. Jordan working Gulf fishing boat steadily, stable life under Sarah Miller name, crew knows her as solid worker who says little.
  - One evening in dock bar, hears river workers (visiting from Mississippi) talking about legend—"Hayes' Daughter" who killed Wade Turner.
  - Stories exaggerated now (claim she sank ten boats, killed fifty men, disappeared into river like ghost), Jordan listens from corner booth saying nothing.
  - Bartender asks if she knows Mississippi River (overhearing conversation), Jordan says "used to" and finishes her beer, leaves bar.
  - Walks to dock, looks at Gulf water, thinks briefly about Cal—no regrets about revenge, did what needed doing, same as Cal taught about boat repairs or navigation (job's done, move to next one).
  - Returns to fishing boat, sleeps below deck. River's behind her now. Different water, different life. Not haunted or redeemed—just finished with that task. Working-class practical. The end.

* **Dialogue Topics:** River workers' legend-telling (exaggerated stories), bartender's casual question, Jordan's minimal response ("used to"), crew small talk (brief, routine), Jordan's internal thoughts (minimal, accepting).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan settled and calm—legend is background noise, doesn't concern her. Brief recognition of Cal's memory (respectful but not dwelling). Satisfaction in completion, ready for next day's work. No drama, just life continuing.

* **Key Details:** Fishing boat (40-footer, crew of four, Jordan accepted member), dock bar (working-class, Texas coast atmosphere, shrimp boats outside), river workers (passing through, Mississippi River talk), Jordan's position (corner booth, beer, listening), brief walk to dock (night, Gulf water, stars), fishing boat cabin (bunk, sleeping bag, simple), morning routine ahead (implied—life continues), Cal's watch (Jordan still carries it hidden, only keepsake), final image (Jordan sleeping peacefully, task complete, new life stable).
