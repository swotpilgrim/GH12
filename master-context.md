# Master Context: VENGEANCE Series (Female-Led Men's Adventure Pulp)

## Project Overview

VENGEANCE is a female-led men's adventure paperback series filling a genuine historical gap: the gritty, working-class female action hero novels that SHOULD have existed in the 1970s but didn't due to market constraints. These are authentic pulp homage pieces—unapologetic, violent, episodic revenge missions with painted covers and cartoon villains.

**Target Output:** Standalone 52,000-word novels, numbered for collectability but readable in any order. Each book features a different working-class heroine in a different 1970s American city, hunting cartoon-evil villains through vivid exploitation settings.

**Market Position:** Retroactive grindhouse literature. Not modern "strong female character™" meta-commentary—these are PULP HEROES who happen to be female, written as if they were actually published in 1976.

## Genre & Editorial Standards

**Primary Genre:** Men's Adventure Pulp (Executioner/Death Merchant lineage)  
**Imprint Identity:** VENGEANCE = Urban revenge stories, hard-edged female vigilantes, 1970s decay  
**Violence Level:** HARD (graphic violence, body counts 25-40, explicit but not gratuitous)  
**Sexual Content:** Period-appropriate (fade-to-black, not focus of narrative)  
**Language:** Working-class authentic, profanity as needed  
**Period:** 1974-1979 America  
**Tone:** Unapologetic pulp, simplified morality (clear good vs. evil), fast-paced action, no literary pretension

**Content Framework - Authentic Within Boundaries:**
- Keep: Hard-boiled protagonists, graphic action, high body counts, simplified morality, anti-establishment themes, gritty settings, pulpy tone, period attitudes, genre conventions
- Adjust only for: Clear policy violations (not taste issues), extreme torture/sadism, anything involving minors, most egregious stereotyping
- Don't "fix": Different 1970s social attitudes, masculine/military culture where appropriate, genre's moral simplicity, pulp conventions modern sensibilities find problematic

**Critical Principle:** She's a pulp hero who happens to be female, NOT a commentary on Strong Female Characters. No meta-awareness, no modern gender politics, no apologizing for violence.

## Men's Adventure Pulp Elements

**Story Engine (Build Order):**
1. **Location First** (vivid, period-specific, dripping with atmosphere)
2. **Villain Second** (cartoon evil, memorable, signature M.O.)
3. **Motivation Third** (personal stakes, clear jeopardy)
4. **Heroine Fourth** (matched perfectly to destroy this specific villain)

**Required Content:**
- Detailed weapon specs (calibers, models, functionality)
- Tactical planning sequences
- Multiple action set pieces per act
- Vivid location atmosphere (smells, sounds, decay, danger)
- Working-class perspective throughout
- High body counts of clearly-deserving villains
- Efficient prose (no literary padding)

**Cartoon Villains:**
Must be scenery-chewing memorable with signature methods:
- Tied to their location/profession (butcher who butchers, captain who drowns, gator-feeder in swamps)
- Clear visual (physical description, costume/uniform, props)
- Quotable dialogue (period slang, catchphrases, biblical quotes, whatever fits)
- Completely evil (no redemption arcs, guilt-free body counts)
- Ultimate death must be satisfying payoff

## Working-Class Heroines (Anti-Mary Sue Framework)

**Critical Rule:** Skills must come from realistic 1970s pathways available to women.

**Approved Skill Acquisition Routes:**
- Military/medical: Army/Navy nurse (Vietnam-era), combat medic, ER nurse in urban hospital
- Family transfer: Father/brother/husband taught her (Green Beret brother, cop father, rancher dad)
- Working-class jobs: Factory work, truck stop waitress, bartender, dispatcher, commercial fishing
- The life itself: Biker culture, criminal subcultures (learned by surviving violent world)
- Victim-turned-operator: Survived trafficking, assault (knows enemy tactics intimately)

**Skills Should Be:**
- Plausible for acquisition through 1970s female pathways
- Incomplete (good with a .38, not weapons encyclopedia)
- Earned through hard experience, not natural genius
- Tied to working-class reality

**Examples:**
✅ "Her Green Beret brother taught her everything before Vietnam killed him"
✅ "Worked ER night shift in South Bronx for 8 years, saw more GSWs than most combat medics"
✅ "Grew up in biker clubhouse, learned to shoot/fight/survive in that world"

❌ "Was Delta Force before Delta Force accepted women"
❌ "Expert in 47 martial arts"
❌ "Genius-level intellect and Olympic athlete"

## Setting Requirements

**Time Period:** 1974-1979 America (post-Vietnam, pre-Reagan)

**Location Types (Choose One Per Book):**
- Decaying urban cores (NYC Times Square, Detroit, Chicago, Bronx)
- Sunbelt boom towns (Miami cocaine cowboys, Vegas mob era, Houston oil)
- Border zones (El Paso/Juárez, Texas-Mexico corridor, desert crossings)
- Industrial districts (docklands, factories, warehouses, refineries)
- Rural/isolated (Appalachian hollows, desert highways, small town corruption)
- Faded resort towns (Atlantic City pre-casinos, Gulf Coast)

**Atmosphere Requirements:**
- Working-class spaces (not penthouses or embassies)
- Cash economy, violence close to surface
- Period-specific decay and danger
- Vivid sensory detail (smells, sounds, textures)
- Heroine can blend in (knows the territory)

## Motivation Archetypes

Mix as needed for maximum personal stakes:

- **Revenge:** They killed family/lover/partner
- **Betrayal:** Frame job, setup, took the fall
- **Rescue:** Someone she cares about is trapped/taken
- **Hunted:** Witnessed crime, now they're coming for her
- **Debt Collection:** Owed money/blood/justice
- **Discovery:** Stumbled into evil, can't walk away
- **Survival:** No way out but through

**Stack motivations for complexity:** Revenge + Rescue, Betrayal + Hunted, Debt + Discovery, etc.

## Villain Archetypes

- Organized crime (mob families, cartels, biker gangs)
- Corrupt officials (dirty cops, politicians, corporate executives)
- Traffickers (drugs, humans, weapons)
- Cultists/extremists (doomsday compounds, radical cells)
- Corporate criminals (developers, oil barons, slumlords)

**Each villain needs:**
- Signature M.O. (how they kill/dispose of victims)
- Visual identity (costume, props, physical description)
- Clear motivation (greed, sadism, ideology—keep simple)
- Quotable dialogue style
- Satisfying death scene potential

## Continuity Model

**Standalone Books:** Each novel is completely self-contained. No required reading order.

**Series Elements:**
- Numbered (VENGEANCE #1, #2, etc.) for collectability
- Consistent trade dress (painted covers, similar typography)
- Shared imprint identity (urban, hard, revenge-driven)
- Same period (1974-1979)
- Same violence level (HARD)

**No Continuity Between Books:**
- Different heroine each book
- Different city/setting each book
- No recurring characters
- No overarching plot

## Outliner Agent Deliverables

When assigned a VENGEANCE book concept, produce THREE documents:

### 1. BIBLE (2,500-3,000 words MAXIMUM)

**Required Sections:**
- Story Premise (150-200 words)
- Protagonist Profile (400-500 words)
- Villain Profile (400-500 words)
- Supporting Characters (600-800 words: 4-6 characters at 100-150 words each)
- Setting Details (400-500 words)
- Tone & Voice Guidelines (200-250 words)
- Weapons & Tactics (200-250 words)
- Themes (150-200 words)

**Critical:** Bible must be LEAN. Scriptwriter loads this entire document every time. No padding, no redundancy, only essential story information.

### 2. MASTER OUTLINE (3,000-4,500 words MAXIMUM)

**Format:** All 30 chapters summarized
**Per Chapter:** 100-150 words MAXIMUM (strict limit)
**Must Track:**
- Plot progression (what happens)
- Body count running total
- Location changes
- Act structure beats
- Rising stakes

**Purpose:** Gives scriptwriter the complete story arc at a glance without overwhelming detail.

### 3. DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINES (7,000-9,000 words total)

**Format:** Beat-by-beat guidance for scriptwriter
**Per Chapter:** 230-300 words (target ~280 words)
**Must Include:**
- Setting & atmosphere
- Scene breakdown (2-4 scenes per chapter typical)
- Character actions (what heroine does)
- Dialogue direction (topics/tone, not actual dialogue)
- Emotional beats (heroine's internal state)
- Violence/action choreography (when applicable)
- Period details to weave in
- Continuity anchors (references to previous chapters)
- Chapter purpose (why this chapter exists)
- Ending hook (how chapter closes)

## Outline Density Standards

**Expansion Ratio:** 1 word of outline → 5-7 words of prose

For 1,733-word chapters, detailed outlines should be 230-300 words (tight guidance, scriptwriter expands through dialogue, description, internalization, atmosphere).

**Example (correct density):**
```
Chapter 5 Outline (275 words):
Elena drives the stolen pickup through pre-dawn El Paso, heading for the crossing point. She's running on coffee and adrenaline, replaying the interrogation from last night—Carnicero's lieutenant gave up the brothel location before she put him down. Setting: industrial zone near border, smell of smelter smoke, empty streets, distant sirens. She checks the .38 in her waistband, the hunting knife in her boot. Both gifts from her daughter's father, years ago. She tries not to think about Maria's body in the morgue.

Arriving at the safe house (run-down duplex, peeling paint, bars on windows), she meets her contact—Diego, mid-50s former cop, lost his own daughter to traffickers. He's nervous, warns her Carnicero has the whole district wired. Every cop, every judge. Elena doesn't care. Diego provides: blueprints of the brothel, shift change times, number of guards (usually 4-5). The women are kept on second floor, locked rooms. Carnicero comes by Thursdays to collect money.

Decision point: Elena can wait for Thursday (3 days, safer odds) or go tonight while she has momentum. She thinks of the other girls still trapped up there, same age as Maria. Can't wait. Diego tries to talk her down—suicide mission, too many guns. She ignores him, takes the blueprints, checks her weapon. Emotional beat: Cold fury overriding fear. She's accepted she might die doing this.

Chapter ends: Elena crossing into Juárez as sun rises, brothel address memorized, knowing she's walking into a kill box but unable to stop. Last thought: "Maria, this is for you."
```

**Scriptwriter expands this to 1,733 words through:**
- Full dialogue (Elena and Diego's entire conversation)
- Sensory description (industrial zone atmosphere, safe house interior)
- Internal thoughts (Elena's grief, rage, tactical calculations)
- Action detail (checking weapons, reviewing blueprints)
- Period details (1979 El Paso, border crossing description)

## Success Criteria
