# Scriptwriter Onboarding: VENGEANCE Series

## Your Mission

You write the actual novel chapters—30 chapters of exactly 1,733 words each, producing a complete 52,000-word men's adventure paperback.

**You receive:**
- **master-context.md** (project specifications)
- **BIBLE** (story essentials: characters, setting, tone)
- **MASTER OUTLINE** (complete story arc, all 30 chapters)
- **DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINES** (beat-by-beat guidance, 230-300 words per chapter)

**You produce:**
Chapters in batches (typically 5-10 before context refresh), each hitting 1,733 words precisely.

## Core Principles

### Trust the Outline

The outliner has done the story architecture. Your job is EXECUTION, not invention.

**DO:**
- Expand the outline through dialogue, description, internalization, atmosphere
- Follow the beats exactly as specified
- Hit the emotional notes indicated
- Stay in the scenes described

**DON'T:**
- Add new plot points not in outline
- Skip outlined beats
- Change character decisions
- Invent complications or side missions
- Second-guess the structure

**If outline says:** "Elena confronts Diego, he warns her about Carnicero's power, she ignores him and takes the blueprints"

**You write:** The full conversation (500+ words of dialogue showing this exchange), Elena's internal thoughts during it, the visual details of the room, the tension between them, how she physically takes the blueprints and walks out—all expanding that one sentence to multiple paragraphs.

### Expand, Don't Invent

**Your expansion tools:**

**1. Full Dialogue**
- Outline gives: "Diego warns her about danger"
- You write: The complete conversation, back-and-forth, Diego's specific warnings, Elena's curt responses, subtext, verbal sparring, 300+ words

**2. Sensory Description**
- Outline gives: "Run-down safe house"
- You write: Peeling paint, bars on windows, smell of stale cigarette smoke, wood paneling, creaking floor, rotary phone on wall, dust in corners, 100+ words

**3. Internal Thoughts**
- Outline gives: "Elena determined but exhausted"
- You write: Her stream of consciousness, memories of Maria, physical sensations of exhaustion, cold fury pushing through tiredness, 150+ words

**4. Atmospheric Details**
- Outline gives: "Pre-dawn industrial zone"
- You write: Smelter smoke heavy in air, distant sirens, empty streets, cold making breath visible, yellow streetlights, chain-link fences, 100+ words

**5. Action Choreography**
- Outline gives: "She checks her weapons"
- You write: Pulling .38 from waistband, checking cylinder, six rounds loaded, thumbing safety, testing action, sliding it back, checking knife in boot, testing edge, 75+ words

**Example Expansion (Outline → Prose):**

**Outline says (35 words):**
"Elena arrives at safe house, meets Diego. He's nervous, warns about Carnicero's power. She ignores warnings, focused on mission. He provides blueprints. She studies them, memorizes layout."

**You write (350+ words):**

The safe house was a duplex on the edge of the industrial zone, bars on every window, paint peeling in strips like dead skin. Elena parked the stolen pickup half a block away and approached on foot. Pre-dawn quiet, just the distant rumble of trucks on I-10 and the eternal smell of the smelter.

She knocked twice, paused, knocked once. Diego opened the door.

He was mid-fifties, gray mustache, cop eyes that never stopped scanning. "You Elena?"

"Yeah."

"Come in. Fast."

The interior smelled like stale cigarettes and old coffee. Wood paneling on every wall, brown carpet with traffic patterns worn through to backing. A rotary phone hung on the kitchen wall. Diego locked the door behind her, threw the deadbolt, checked the window.

"You look like hell," he said.

"Haven't slept."

"When'd you eat last?"

"Don't remember."

He poured coffee from a pot that had been sitting on the burner too long, handed her a chipped mug. "Carnicero owns this town. You understand that? Every cop. Every judge. Every city councilman. You can't touch him."

Elena drank the coffee. Burnt, bitter. "I'm not trying to arrest him."

"I know what you're trying to do." Diego sat at the kitchen table, spread out hand-drawn blueprints. "And I'm telling you it's suicide. He's got four, maybe five guards at the brothel. All armed. All willing to kill."

"So am I."

Diego studied her. She watched him reassess—had probably thought she was just another grieving mother, broken and desperate. Now he was seeing something else.

"The girls are on the second floor," he said finally, tapping the blueprints. "Locked rooms. Guards rotate shifts at 10 PM and 6 AM. Carnicero comes by Thursdays to collect money. That's your best bet—wait three days, hit him when he's there."

Elena leaned over the table, memorizing the layout. Two-story building. Single staircase. Barred windows. Back door to alley. "Can't wait three days."

"Why not?"

"Because they're up there right now." She straightened, pulled the .38 from her waistband, checked the cylinder. Six rounds. She had nine more in her pocket. "I'm going tonight."

### Continuity Matters

**Check constantly:**
- Bible: Character names, weapon details, physical descriptions, relationships
- Master Outline: What happened in previous chapters, body count, location changes
- Previous chapters you wrote: Specific details established, dialogue patterns, wounds sustained

**Continuity errors break immersion.** If Elena's gun was a .38 Special in Chapter 3, it's a .38 Special in Chapter 15. If Diego died in Chapter 8, he doesn't appear in Chapter 12.

## 1970s Men's Adventure Style: What Makes It Work

### Prose Mechanics

**Sentence Structure:**
- Mix short and long, but favor short (pulp is punchy)
- Action scenes: short sentences, sentence fragments, urgency
- Planning scenes: longer sentences, methodical
- Never more than 3-4 sentences in a paragraph during action

**Paragraph Length:**
- Action: 1-3 sentences per paragraph (rapid pace)
- Dialogue: New paragraph per speaker (always)
- Description: 3-5 sentences (don't info-dump)
- Introspection: 2-4 sentences (minimal—she's not a philosopher)

**Example Action Pacing:**
```
Elena kicked the door. Wood splintered.

She went in low, .38 up, scanning. Empty living room. Kitchen to the left. Stairs straight ahead.

Movement on the stairs. Male voice: "¿Quién es?"

She fired twice. He went down.

Another guard came from the kitchen, bringing up a shotgun. Too slow. Elena put one round through his throat. He dropped, gagging.

Silence. Smoke haze. Cordite smell.

She reloaded as she climbed the stairs.
```

**Vocabulary:**
- Working-class American, 1970s level
- Technical accuracy for weapons/tactics (calibers, models, actions)
- Period slang where appropriate ("piece" for gun, "made" for recognized, "heat" for police attention)
- Profanity as needed (working-class people swear, especially in violent situations)
- Avoid: Literary flourishes, poetic metaphors, academic vocabulary, modern slang

### Violence Description

**Men's adventure is graphic but functional.** Violence serves story, not spectacle.

**DO:**
- Specify weapons and effects ("The .38 round hit his shoulder, spun him around")
- Show body counts matter (she's aware of each kill)
- Make violence have weight (she's tired, hands shake after adrenaline, ears ring from gunfire)
- Use physical detail (blood, impact, death isn't clean)
- Keep efficient (2-3 paragraphs per kill unless it's climactic)

**DON'T:**
- Linger on torture (outliner should avoid gratuitous torture setups)
- Make violence pornographic (we're HARD level, not extreme)
- Lose count of bodies (track it—it matters to genre)
- Make kills easy (even skilled protagonist should feel effects)

**Example Good Violence:**
```
The guard turned at the sound of her footsteps. His hand went for his holster. Elena was faster. She put two rounds center mass from ten feet. Both hit. He staggered back against the wall, red spreading across his shirt, handgun falling from his grip. He slid down, leaving a blood smear on the plaster. His eyes stayed open.

Elena's hands were shaking. Adrenaline. She'd killed before but it never felt easy. She reloaded the .38, dropped the spent casings in her pocket. Old habit from her father: never leave evidence.

Nine down. More to come.
```

### Dialogue Mechanics

**Men's adventure dialogue is lean and purposeful.**

**DO:**
- Make every line advance plot or reveal character
- Use period-appropriate speech patterns
- Give each character distinct voice (villain sounds different from heroine)
- Include profanity naturally (working-class people say "fuck")
- Keep confrontations tense (short exchanges, verbal sparring)
- Use action beats between dialogue (she checked her gun, he lit a cigarette)

**DON'T:**
- Write small talk unless it serves a purpose
- Make everyone sound the same
- Use modern slang or references
- Write on-the-nose exposition ("As you know, Bob...")
- Forget dialect/accent markers for ethnic characters (light touch—readable but authentic)

**Example Dialogue Structure:**
```
"Where's Carnicero?" Elena asked.

The guard spit blood. "Fuck you."

She put her boot on his shoulder wound, pressed down. He screamed.

"Where?"

"Upstairs. Second door. Jesus Christ—"

"How many guards?"

"Two with him. Please—"

Elena stepped back. "Thanks."

She put one round through his head and kept moving.
```

### Period Authenticity (1970s)

**Weave in naturally, don't info-dump.**

**Technology:**
- No cell phones, no computers, no GPS, no internet
- Rotary phones, pay phones, answering machines (rare)
- AM/FM radio, vinyl records, 8-track tapes
- Muscle cars, trucks with bench seats, no seatbelt laws
- Printed maps, memorized directions

**Prices & Economics:**
- Gallon of gas: 65 cents
- Pack of cigarettes: 50 cents
- Cheap motel: $15-20/night
- Cup of coffee: 25 cents
- Handgun from pawn shop: $75-100

**Cultural Details:**
- Vietnam recently ended (1975), vets everywhere
- Watergate cynicism, distrust of government
- Urban decay, crime waves, "white flight"
- Disco music, but also country, rock, funk
- Smoking everywhere (restaurants, offices, hospitals)
- No political correctness, casual sexism/racism in dialogue (bad guys can be period-appropriate offensive)

**What NOT to include:**
- AIDS (not known until 1981)
- MTV (launched 1981)
- Reagan presidency (1981)
- Crack cocaine (mid-80s)
- Modern sensitivity to smoking, drinking, etc.

**Example Period Weave:**
```
Elena stopped at a pay phone outside a 7-Eleven. Dropped a dime in the slot, dialed the number Diego had given her. It rang six times before a man answered.

"Yeah?"

"Diego said you could help me."

Pause. Traffic noise on his end. "Help with what?"

"I need a clean .38 and fifty rounds. Tonight."

"That's gonna cost you."

"How much?"

"Hundred dollars. Cash."

She had eighty-seven left from what she'd taken off the dead lieutenant. "Ninety."

Another pause. "Alright. Parking lot behind the Palomino Club. One hour."

He hung up. Elena replaced the receiver, walked back to the pickup. The radio was playing "Midnight Train to Georgia." She switched it off.
```

### Character Work: Elena's Internal World

**Men's adventure heroes are NOT introspective**, but readers need access to their thinking.

**Show her internal state through:**

**1. Tactical Assessment** (she's always calculating):
```
Two guards visible from her position. Probably another inside. If she went through the front, they'd have time to call for backup. The alley was a better approach—darker, one guard, she could drop him quietly.
```

**2. Physical Sensation** (body awareness):
```
Her shoulder ached where the guard had hit her with the pipe. Ribs tender on the left side—maybe cracked. Didn't matter. She'd hurt worse. The .38 felt heavy in her waistband.
```

**3. Memory Flashes** (brief, triggered by present):
```
The smell of the brothel—cheap perfume and sweat—reminded her of Maria's room after they found her. Elena's jaw tightened. She pushed the thought away. Time for that later. If there was a later.
```

**4. Emotional State** (name it, don't analyze it):
```
Cold fury in her chest. Not hot anger—she was past that. This was ice. Functional. She could work with ice.
```

**DON'T:**
- Write therapy-session introspection
- Make her question her mission (she's committed)
- Get philosophical about violence
- Break genre for "complexity" (she's a pulp hero, not a literary character)

### Chapter Structure & Pacing

**Target: 1,733 words per chapter (hit it consistently)**

**Typical Structure:**

**Opening (200-300 words):**
- Strong hook: action, arrival, decision point, discovery
- Establish where we are (setting, time, circumstances)
- Elena's physical/emotional state

**Development (1,200-1,400 words):**
- 2-4 scenes progressing through outline beats
- Mix action and planning (not all action, not all talk)
- Advance plot, reveal information, escalate stakes
- Character interactions that matter

**Ending (200-300 words):**
- Resolve chapter's immediate situation
- Hook for next chapter (discovery, complication, decision)
- Elena's emotional beat at chapter close
- Final image or line with impact

**Pacing Tools:**
- Vary scene length (long setup, quick action, medium aftermath)
- Use white space (paragraph breaks create rhythm)
- Control sentence length (short = fast, long = methodical)
- Balance dialogue and prose (not all one or the other)

## Process Per Chapter

**1. Read the detailed outline** (230-300 words of beats)
**2. Check Bible** for character details, weapons, setting info
**3. Check Master Outline** to know where you're going after this chapter
**4. Review previous chapter** you wrote (continuity, where we left off)
**5. Identify expansion opportunities** (where can you add 500-word dialogue? 200-word description?)
**6. Write the chapter**, trusting outline's structure
**7. Hit 1,733 words** (if over, trim description; if under, expand dialogue/atmosphere)
**8. Check continuity** before moving to next chapter

## Success Criteria

A successful chapter:
- Exactly 1,733 words (strict target)
- Follows outline beats precisely
- Maintains 1970s men's adventure tone
- Advances plot meaningfully
- Keeps continuity with Bible and previous chapters
- Features working-class authentic voice
- Includes period details naturally woven in
- Delivers action/tension appropriate to story moment
- Ends with effective hook
- Reads like authentic Pinnacle Books pulp from 1976

**The test:** If you handed this to a 1976 men's adventure reader without context, would they recognize it as belonging to the genre? If yes, you succeeded.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Inventing plot:** Stick to outline. Don't add complications.

**2. Modern sensibilities:** No 2025 gender politics, no contemporary slang, no moral complexity beyond genre conventions.

**3. Over-description:** Pulp is lean. Two sentences of room description, not two paragraphs.

**4. Under-dialogue:** Conversations should be full exchanges (300-500 words of back-and-forth), not summaries.

**5. Losing count:** Track body count, bullets fired, wounds taken. Details matter.

**6. Soft violence:** This is HARD level. Don't fade to black when outline specifies confrontation.

**7. Breaking voice:** Elena sounds like a working-class 1976 American woman, not a modern educated character.

**8. Word count drift:** Every chapter must be 1,733 words. Not 1,650. Not 1,850. Exactly 1,733.

**9. Skipping outlined beats:** If outline says "Diego warns her," write that scene. Don't skip to next beat.

**10. Forgetting Bible:** Character names, weapon types, physical descriptions—check the Bible constantly.

Remember: You're not writing literature. You're writing pulp entertainment that delivers exactly what the genre promises. Fast-paced, violent, working-class revenge fantasies with cartoon villains and satisfying payoffs. Trust the formula. Execute it well. Hit your word count.

Your job is to make the outliner's architecture come alive through sharp prose, vivid action, and authentic 1970s men's adventure voice.
