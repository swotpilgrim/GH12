# DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINES: RIVER REVENGE (Chapters 1-15)

## Chapter 1: "River Funeral"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Cheap cemetery near President's Island docks, Memphis
Time: Morning, overcast, early September 1978

* **Purpose:** Establish Jordan's grief and determination while introducing Wade Turner as the false-mourning villain.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan stands at Cal's graveside listening to preacher lie about accidental drowning—she knows better, sees the inconsistencies.
  - Wade Turner attends funeral playing grieving boss, offers condolences and Cal's final paycheck, Jordan takes money silently while studying him.
  - After funeral Jordan returns to Cal's rented room above riverside bar, searches it methodically, finds hidden notebook behind loose baseboard.
  - Notebook contains smuggling documentation: barge numbers, dates, names, routes—evidence Cal died protecting.
  - Jordan takes notebook, keys to *Proud Mary*, Cal's Remington 870 shotgun and deer rifle from closet, makes decision without speaking it aloud.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Preacher's generic funeral platitudes, Turner's false sympathy ("Cal was good man, tragic accident"), brief exchange with bar owner about clearing Cal's room, Jordan's minimal responses.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan maintains cold exterior throughout funeral, refusing to cry in public. Rage builds silently as Turner speaks. Alone in Cal's room, she allows herself one moment of grief before shutting it down and loading weapons.

* **Key Details:** Memphis dock atmosphere (diesel smell, barge horns), Cal's sparse room (unmade bed, work boots, river charts), notebook hidden carefully (Cal knew danger), Turner's physical presence (barrel-chested, missing ear piece, cigar), Jordan's work clothes at funeral (no dress, refuses to perform grief).

## Chapter 2: "The Drowning"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person (flashback framed as nightmare/memory)
Setting: Riverside Freight dock, Memphis—night shift
Time: Two weeks prior to Chapter 1, late August, after midnight

* **Purpose:** Show Cal's death to establish stakes and justify Jordan's revenge through witnessed brutality.

* **Beats:**
  - Cal working night shift sees drugs being loaded into modified barge compartment, recognizes operation's scope.
  - Next morning Cal confronts Turner in dock office, genuinely believes boss doesn't know about smuggling, offers to keep quiet if it stops.
  - Turner smiles, quotes Jonah 1:15 about throwing men overboard, Cal realizes his fatal mistake too late.
  - That night Keller and Boone grab Cal at dock, wrap chains while Turner supervises, Cal fights and begs thinking of Jordan alone.
  - Turner personally pushes Cal off dock, watches him sink, says "River takes what river wants," body surfaces three days later downriver.
  - Return to present: Jordan on *Proud Mary* reading Cal's notes, understanding exactly what happened, loading shotgun shells methodically.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Cal's naive attempt to reason with Turner, Turner's biblical justifications mixed with cold threats, Keller and Boone's crude commentary, Cal's final plea mentioning Jordan, Turner's dismissive response.

* **Emotional Arc:** Flashback shows Cal's transformation from confident to terrified. Present Jordan relives it through notes and imagination, hardens her resolve—grief converts fully to cold rage and tactical planning.

* **Key Details:** Night dock setting (security lights, water lapping, diesel generators), chain weight specifics (40 pounds, industrial), Cal's body position underwater (eyes open, hands clawing), Turner's Bible (leather-bound, bookmarked), Jordan's physical reaction reading notes (white knuckles, jaw tight).

## Chapter 3: "Fuel Dock"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Industrial fuel dock, Memphis
Time: Tuesday evening, dusk, early September

* **Purpose:** Jordan's first kill—establish her capability and willingness to execute revenge through direct action.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan stakes out fuel dock where Keller works part-time, has watched for two days learning his routine.
  - She approaches on foot (left *Proud Mary* moored upstream), shotgun broken down and hidden under canvas jacket, assembles it behind diesel tanks.
  - Keller arrives alone in company truck to fuel barges, Jordan confronts him, he recognizes her and says something crude about Cal.
  - She shoots him twice without hesitation (chest, head), clinical execution, drags body to dock edge using his own shirt.
  - Wraps body in mooring chains (deliberate irony), dumps in river, takes his wallet/keys/pistol, returns to *Proud Mary* with shaking hands—first kill complete.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Keller's crude recognition ("Well shit, Cal's little girl"), Jordan's minimal questions ("You drown him?"), Keller's attempt to play innocent, Jordan's final words before shooting (if any—consider silence more powerful).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan approaches with cold determination but adrenaline spikes during confrontation. After kill, physical reaction (shaking, nausea) but no regret—she did what needed doing, same as any river work.

* **Key Details:** Fuel dock isolation (closed for evening), diesel pump mechanics, shotgun assembly process, Keller's body weight (heavy, difficult to drag), chain wrapping technique (copied from how they killed Cal), river current taking body, Jordan's hands shaking lighting cigarette after.

## Chapter 4: "Isolation"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Barge fleeting area upriver from Memphis
Time: Early morning, Thursday, fog on river

* **Purpose:** Second kill establishes pattern and shows Jordan's tactical approach using river knowledge as advantage.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan motors *Proud Mary* upstream at dawn to fleeting area (where empty barges park), knows Ray Boone works there from Cal's notes.
  - Finds Boone alone on tethered barge doing maintenance, approaches slowly playing lost tourist needing directions.
  - Boone leers and approaches, Jordan pulls Colt Python from jacket, shoots him in stomach at close range.
  - Boards barge, stands over wounded Boone, asks "You remember Cal Hayes?" watches recognition and fear, shoots him in head.
  - Wraps body in chains using barge equipment, dumps between barges where current will drag under, searches pockets (finds nothing useful), returns to *Proud Mary* heading back to Memphis.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Jordan's tourist act ("Is this the channel to...?"), Boone's crude flirting, Jordan's cold question about Cal, Boone's attempted plea (cut short by gunshot).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan calmer than first kill—approaching it like work assignment. Brief satisfaction watching Boone recognize why he's dying. No shaking after this one, just mechanical cleanup and departure.

* **Key Details:** Morning fog atmosphere (limited visibility, muffled sound), fleeting area layout (barges chained together, isolated), barge maintenance details (welding gear, tools), Boone's gut-shot reaction (realistic wounding), underwater current between barges (dangerous, bodies stay down), Jordan's mechanical efficiency.

## Chapter 5: "The Coordinator"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Riverside bar parking lot and isolated dock, Memphis
Time: Friday night into early Saturday morning

* **Purpose:** Third kill extracts intelligence about Turner's operation while escalating Jordan's tactical confidence.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan identifies Travis Polk (smuggling coordinator) from Cal's notes, follows him for two days learning routine—he drinks at The Anchor every night.
  - Friday night Jordan waits in bar parking lot, Polk leaves drunk and alone around 11pm, she confronts him behind his truck with rifle.
  - Forces him at gunpoint to talk, he caves quickly (not hardened criminal), confirms Turner runs operation, names other smugglers, admits Keller and Boone drowned Cal on Turner's orders.
  - Jordan shoots him after extracting information, loads body in his truck, drives to isolated dock, dumps truck and body in river using stolen tow truck winch.
  - Walks three miles back to *Proud Mary* (left it moored elsewhere), processes new intelligence about operation's scope, plans next moves.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Polk's drunken pleading, Jordan's specific questions (who runs it, how many people, where are records kept), Polk's bargaining attempts (offering money, information for life), Jordan's decision to kill him anyway.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan coldly pragmatic—uses Polk for intel then executes plan. Brief moment of doubt (he's pathetic, not hardened killer) but remembers Cal and proceeds. Growing confidence in her capabilities.

* **Key Details:** Bar parking lot (gravel, single light, truck row), Polk's drunk stumbling, rifle aimed at chest (steady hands now), truck interior (bench seat, blood splatter), isolated dock mechanics (winch operation, truck sinking slowly), three-mile walk in darkness (Jordan knows Memphis docks by heart).

## Chapter 6: "Recognition"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: *Proud Mary* and riverside meeting with Marcus Webb
Time: Saturday afternoon and evening

* **Purpose:** Turner recognizes the threat pattern while Jordan gains intelligence from ally, raising stakes for both sides.

* **Beats:**
  - Turner calls emergency meeting with remaining crew at Riverside Freight, warns three people dead in one week (all smugglers, all river burials), suspects rival cartel operation.
  - Turner's people nervous, some want out, he locks down operation and offers bounty for information, doesn't suspect Cal's daughter (dismisses her as grieving girl).
  - Meanwhile Jordan contacts Marcus Webb (legitimate deckhand, Cal's friend), meets him at isolated riverside spot, asks about smuggling operation.
  - Webb reluctant (has family, fears Turner) but owes Cal's memory, tells Jordan which barge captains are dirty, when next smuggling shipment runs (Friday night heading downriver).
  - Jordan decides to hit the barge itself (escalation from killing individuals), Webb warns she'll get killed, she thanks him and leaves, he watches her go knowing he can't stop her.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Turner's meeting (threats, paranoia, orders), Jordan and Webb's conversation (Webb's reluctance, memories of Cal, tactical intel about barge schedules and smuggler identities, Webb's fatherly warning), Jordan's minimal thanks.

* **Emotional Arc:** Turner's confidence shaken—someone's hunting his operation effectively. Jordan gains useful ally but recognizes Webb's limits (won't fight, just providing info). Growing sense of mission momentum.

* **Key Details:** Turner's dock office (maps, radio, cigars), crew's nervous faces, Webb's meeting location (abandoned loading dock, private), Webb's physical details (50s, graying, work-worn), barge schedule specifics (Friday 9pm departure, four-day run to New Orleans), *Proud Mary* being loaded with extra ammunition and fuel.

## Chapter 7: "Barge Takedown"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Mississippi River, isolated stretch 40 miles south of Memphis

* **Purpose:** Major escalation—Jordan attacks Turner's operation directly, killing five and destroying drug shipment worth half million.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan follows smuggling barge (disguised as grain shipment) downriver in *Proud Mary*, running dark without lights, waits until isolated stretch where crew beds down.
  - Rams *Proud Mary* at speed into barge crew quarters, boards during chaos with shotgun, five crew scrambling (captain, engineer, three deckhands all armed).
  - Firefight on barge deck under three minutes: shotgun drops two immediately, third pulls pistol and she shoots him with rifle, captain and engineer try reaching weapons and she kills both.
  - Searches barge, finds drug compartment welded into hull (tons of cocaine in waterproof packages), opens flood valves to sink barge deliberately.
  - Escapes on *Proud Mary* as barge sinks slowly with bodies and cargo, listens to radio chatter later reporting barge missing, crew presumed drowned.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Brief shouted warnings during firefight ("Armed!" "Starboard side!"), crew's panicked questions, Jordan's silence (no talking, just shooting), radio chatter afterward (Coast Guard, other boats discussing missing barge).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan focused and tactical during approach—this is planned operation, not rage kill. During firefight pure survival instinct, afterward brief moment of shock at five bodies but buries it. Satisfaction sinking drug cargo—hitting Turner where it hurts.

* **Key Details:** Night river navigation (no lights, starlight only, knowing channels by memory), *Proud Mary*'s ramming impact (steel hull, diesel engines at full throttle), barge deck layout (crew quarters aft, cargo forward), weapon specifics (shotgun for close quarters, rifle for distance), drug compartment engineering (false hull, welded seams), barge sinking slowly (air escaping, water filling), *Proud Mary* damage (bow dented, functional).

## Chapter 8: "Point of No Return"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Tennessee river town and crossing into Mississippi
Time: Sunday through Monday, late September

* **Purpose:** Aftermath of barge attack—Turner escalates response while Jordan commits fully to hunt, crossing point of no return.

* **Beats:**
  - Turner learns barge sank with crew and cargo (half million loss), realizes this isn't rival cartel but personal vendetta, his people getting nervous.
  - Jordan restocks at Tennessee sporting goods store (pays cash for ammunition, camping supplies), refuels *Proud Mary* at commercial dock, buys groceries at truck stop.
  - Radio chatter indicates Turner sending hunters south to patrol river looking for whoever's attacking his operation, offering bounty.
  - Jordan crosses Tennessee-Mississippi state line at night, heading deeper into Turner's territory, knows she's committed now—can't stop until Turner's dead or she is.
  - Moors in hidden cove just south of state line, checks weapons, counts ammunition (limited supply now), accepts she's likely going to die doing this but proceeding anyway.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Sporting goods clerk (small talk about hunting season), fuel dock attendant (weather talk), radio chatter (Turner's boats coordinating patrol patterns, bounty discussion), Jordan's internal monologue (minimal—accepts situation without philosophizing).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan methodical and practical—restocking like provisioning for extended river work. Brief moment acknowledging she's crossing into more danger but no hesitation. Settled acceptance: this is the job, see it through.

* **Key Details:** Sporting goods store (rural Tennessee, cash transaction, boxes of shells and slugs), fuel dock (diesel pumps, commercial transaction, other boats around), radio traffic details (Coast Guard frequency, towboat channels, coded language about "problem"), Mississippi state line marker (river buoy), hidden cove (overgrown inlet, good concealment), ammunition inventory (specific counts for shotgun/rifle/pistol).

Time: Tuesday evening into night

* **Purpose:** First kill on Mississippi soil establishes Jordan's hunting pattern—methodical elimination of Turner's network.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan moors *Proud Mary* in hidden cove, scouts nearby river town on foot, identifies Riverside Freight fuel station run by two workers (both on Cal's smuggler list).
  - Waits until station closes (7pm), confronts both workers in fuel yard, they're armed but she has rifle from cover position behind fuel tanks.
  - Kills first worker with headshot (he reaches for pistol), second runs toward office, she chases on foot and shoots him behind diesel storage tanks.
  - Drags both bodies to dock using fuel yard crane, dumps in river, sets small fire to cover evidence (fuel spill "accident").
  - Escapes downriver on *Proud Mary* before fire trucks arrive, listens to radio chatter about fuel station fire, two employees missing presumed caught in blaze.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Jordan's confrontation ("You work for Turner?"), workers' defensive questions, brief exchange before shooting, radio traffic about fire response.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan efficient and detached—these are targets on list, same as barge maintenance tasks. Brief adrenaline spike during chase, then back to calm. Fire covers her tracks—smart tactical thinking.

* **Key Details:** Small town atmosphere (main street, river view, working docks), fuel station layout (commercial pumps, storage tanks, office shed, crane for equipment), workers' routine (closing checklist), rifle shot specifics (scoped, 100 yards, clean headshot), second worker's panic run, crane operation (loading bodies), fuel fire setup (cut line, lighter, natural-looking), *Proud Mary*'s quick departure.

Time: Wednesday afternoon

* **Purpose:** Jordan gains intelligence from Diane Trosclair while establishing ally who will help later—building to next target.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan motors into Arkansas river territory, needs information about Turner's network south of Memphis, remembers Cal mentioning Diane Trosclair who runs riverside bar.
  - Finds The River Rat (working-class bar, dock behind it), goes inside afternoon (slow time), meets Diane behind bar.
  - Diane recognizes Hayes name immediately, knew Cal years back, sizes Jordan up and understands situation without it being stated.
  - Jordan asks if Diane knows Turner's smuggling schedules in Arkansas, Diane hesitant (dangerous knowledge) but respects direct approach—sells information for cash ($200).
  - Diane tells Jordan about Captain Eddie Voss who runs smuggling barges out of dock 15 miles south, warns her Turner has hunters looking, Jordan thanks her and leaves.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Diane's cautious greeting, Jordan introducing herself as Cal's daughter, Diane's memories of Cal (brief, respectful), business transaction about information (cash for names and locations), Diane's warning about hunters, Jordan's minimal thanks.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan appreciates Diane's no-bullshit approach—straight business, no judgment, no unnecessary sympathy. Brief connection to Cal's past (Diane knew him) but Jordan doesn't linger on it. Focused on next target.

* **Key Details:** The River Rat atmosphere (wood paneling, neon beer signs, river view through windows, dock behind), Diane's appearance (38, tough, competent bartender), afternoon emptiness (two old-timers at corner table), cash transaction, Voss's dock location (mile marker, specific barge mooring), Jordan's brief meal (burger and coffee, first real food in days).

## Chapter 11: "Captain Voss"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Isolated Arkansas dock, Voss's towboat
Time: Wednesday night into Thursday pre-dawn

* **Purpose:** Extract intelligence through interrogation then eliminate target—Jordan's tactics evolving to gather information before killing.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan finds Eddie Voss's towboat moored at isolated dock (commercial vessel, 65-foot), approaches after midnight, boards quietly through stern.
  - Voss in wheelhouse with lieutenant drinking whiskey, Jordan enters with shotgun leveled, orders both down to deck.
  - Interrogates Voss: how many smuggling runs monthly, when's next shipment, where does Turner keep records—Voss talks to save his life (gives up New Orleans dock office location).
  - Jordan shoots Voss anyway (can't leave him to warn Turner), lieutenant tries for pistol on desk, she kills him too.
  - Searches towboat, finds logbooks with smuggling routes and dates (evidence), opens wheelhouse seacocks to sink boat slowly, escapes on *Proud Mary*.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Jordan's orders ("On your knees, hands visible"), Voss's questions (who are you, what do you want), interrogation specifics (Jordan's tactical questions, Voss's increasingly desperate answers), Voss's final plea bargain (information for life), Jordan's decision to kill anyway.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan cold and tactical—treats interrogation like work task, extracts information efficiently. Brief calculation about letting Voss live (too dangerous) then executes decision without hesitation. Pragmatic, not sadistic.

* **Key Details:** Night approach (no moon, stars only), towboat layout (wheelhouse elevated, living quarters below), Voss and lieutenant drinking (bourbon, cards on table), shotgun control of room, interrogation specifics (Jordan asks precise questions—dates, locations, security details), logbook contents (handwritten entries, routes, payments), seacock mechanics (flooding wheelhouse slowly), towboat sinking as Jordan motors away.

## Chapter 12: "Mississippi Dawn"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Mississippi River main channel and public dock
Time: Thursday dawn through afternoon

* **Purpose:** Major confrontation with Turner's hunters—Jordan faces coordinated opposition and prevails through superior river knowledge.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan motors deeper into Mississippi, encounters Turner's hunter patrol (two boats searching for *Proud Mary*), she spots them first (knows river, watching for them).
  - Hides in side channel while hunters pass, then follows them downstream, waits until they moor at public dock for night.
  - Ambushes after dark: shoots guard on first boat with rifle (one shot, head), boards and kills sleeping second man with knife (quiet), moves to second boat.
  - Third boat crew wakes (noise), firefight on dock, she kills both with shotgun, fourth man from second boat escapes into town shouting alarm.
  - Jordan scuttles both boats (opens drain plugs, sinks them at dock), flees downriver before response, knows Turner now knows she's using *Proud Mary*.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Hunter radio chatter (coordinating search pattern), Jordan's whispered curses during approach, brief shouted firefight exchange, escaping hunter's alarm shouts.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jordan's tactical advantage (superior river knowledge) gives her confidence but firefight is close call—fourth man escaping means Turner gets description of her boat. New pressure: can't hide as easily now.

* **Key Details:** Side channel hiding (narrow inlet, tree cover, current slack), hunter boats (commercial fishing boats, armed men), public dock layout (wooden, floating, fuel pumps), night ambush approach (crawling along dock, rifle scope at close range), knife work (quiet killing, brutal), shotgun firefight (buckshot at 15 feet, dock planks splintering), boats sinking at moorings, *Proud Mary* running dark downriver.

## Chapter 13: "Hunted"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Overgrown slough and Vicksburg area docks
Time: Friday through Saturday

* **Purpose:** Pressure increases—Jordan must adapt tactics as Turner's network actively hunts her, forcing strategic change.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan hides *Proud Mary* in overgrown slough (tree cover, off main channel), knows Turner's people now looking for her specific boat.
  - Steals small motorboat from unattended dock, uses it to scout Vicksburg area (can't risk *Proud Mary* being spotted).
  - Learns from river gossip (dock conversations, bar talk) that Turner's offering $10,000 bounty on whoever's hitting his operation—every river rat watching now.
  - Observes Vicksburg docks, identifies two Turner enforcers actively watching for her, realizes she can't move freely anymore.
  - Decides to change tactics: hit harder and faster, go directly after Turner's biggest remaining asset—Captain Frank Guidry who runs New Orleans operation.

* **Dialogue Topics:** River workers' gossip about bounty and attacks on Turner's operation, bar conversations (Jordan listening from corner), brief exchange stealing motorboat (leaves cash and note—not theft, borrowing), Jordan's internal tactical planning.

* **Emotional Arc:** First time Jordan feels hunted rather than hunter—psychological shift. Brief moment of doubt (surrounded by potential enemies, every stranger could be Turner's) but pushes through. Adapts strategy: go faster, hit harder, end it.

* **Key Details:** Slough hiding spot (cypress trees, still water, mosquitoes, heat), stolen motorboat (12-foot aluminum, small outboard), Vicksburg dock atmosphere (larger port, commercial traffic, suspicious faces), Turner's enforcers (watching fuel docks, asking questions), bounty details ($10,000 cash, no questions asked), tactical planning aboard hidden *Proud Mary* (maps, remaining ammunition count, distance to New Orleans).

## Chapter 14: "Night Crossing"

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Mississippi River, night run toward Louisiana
Time: Saturday night through Sunday pre-dawn

* **Purpose:** Tense evasion sequence as Jordan runs Turner's patrol line at night, close call raises stakes before midpoint battle.

* **Beats:**
  - Jordan retrieves *Proud Mary* from hiding, must run downriver at night to get past Turner's patrol boats (they're watching all day traffic).
  - Night run navigation (no lights, running by starlight and river knowledge, dangerous at speed), passes two patrol boats in darkness.
  - Close call: patrol spotlight sweeps across water, nearly catches *Proud Mary*, Jordan kills engine and drifts in darkness holding breath.
  - Patrol passes within 50 yards, searchlight sweeping, voices audible, Jordan completely still in wheelhouse (one sound and they find her).
  - After patrol passes she restarts engine, continues south, crosses into Louisiana waters at dawn—below Turner's patrol line now but he knows she's heading south.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Jordan's whispered prayers/curses during close call, patrol boat radio chatter (barely audible across water), Jordan's internal dialogue calculating risks.

* **Emotional Arc:** Sustained tension throughout night run—Jordan's confidence tested by near-miss. Physical fear (hands shaking, breath shallow) but maintains discipline. Relief crossing Louisiana line mixed with knowledge Turner's setting trap ahead.

* **Key Details:** Night river conditions (no moon, starlight on water, current sounds, temperature drop), *Proud Mary* running dark (no running lights, instruments covered), navigation by feel and memory (knowing channel markers by position), patrol boat searchlight (brilliant white, sweeping pattern), Jordan's stillness (barely breathing, hand on wheel frozen), engine restart sequence (starter motor loud in silence), Louisiana state line marker (changing water character, wider channel).

## Chapter 15: "River Battle" (MIDPOINT)

Target Word Count: 1,733 words
POV: Jordan Hayes, first person
Setting: Mississippi River near Baton Rouge, narrow channels
Time: Sunday afternoon into evening

* **Purpose:** Midpoint action climax—Jordan faces coordinated kill squad, defeats them through river knowledge and ruthlessness, emerges wounded but victorious.

* **Beats:**
  - Turner's kill squad finds *Proud Mary* near Baton Rouge (three boats, nine armed men, coordinated attack), river chase begins.
  - Jordan can't outrun them (*Proud Mary* slower than their boats), leads them into narrow channels and shallow water—uses river knowledge as weapon.
  - Two boats ground in shallows, seven men continue pursuit (three on boat, four along bank shooting), firefight: Jordan uses rifle from wheelhouse picking off three.
  - Remaining six pursue on foot, Jordan rams *Proud Mary* into bank, uses it as cover, kills two more with shotgun during flanking attempt.
  - Final four try to surround her position, she shoots fuel tank on one of their grounded boats, explosion kills three, last man flees.
  - Jordan wounded (bullet grazed ribs), *Proud Mary* damaged (engine running rough, hull holed), limps downriver to Diane's dock seeking refuge.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Kill squad radio coordination, shouted orders during firefight, Jordan's tactical cursing, explosion aftermath screaming.

* **Emotional Arc:** Pure survival mode—Jordan fighting for her life, adrenaline overriding fear. Satisfaction in explosion (took most of them), then pain of wound sets in. Realization she nearly died, still has to finish this.

* **Key Details:** Three-boat pursuit (formation, speed), narrow channel tactics (Jordan's knowledge of depth, sandbars), grounding boats (propellers hitting mud), rifle work (scoped shots from wheelhouse, specific targeting), ramming bank (intentional beaching), shotgun defense (buckshot at close range, brutal efficiency), fuel tank explosion (massive fireball, shrapnel, bodies), Jordan's wound (right ribs, bleeding, painful breathing), *Proud Mary*'s damage (engine knock, water in bilge, steering sluggish), blood on wheelhouse controls.
